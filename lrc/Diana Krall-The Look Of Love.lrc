  Lyrics： 
 The Look of Love
 
 The look of love 
 Is in your eyes
 The look your smile can't disguise
 The look of love
 Is saying so much more
 Than just words could ever say
 And what my heart has heard
 Well it takes my breath away
 
 I can hardly wait to hold you
 Feel my arms around you
 How long I have waited
 Waited just to love you
 Now that I have found you
 
 You've got the look of love
 It's on your face
 A look that time can't erase
 Be mine tonight
 Let this be just the start
 Of so many nights like this
 Let's take a lover's vow
 And then seal it with a kiss
 
 I can hardly wait to hold you
 Feel my arms around you
 How long I have waited
 Waited just to love you
 Now that I have found you
 Don't ever go
 Don't ever go
 I love you so
 
 I can hardly wait to hold you
 Feel my arms around you
 How long I have waited
 Waited just to love you
 Now that I have found you
 Don't ever go
 Don't ever go
 Don't ever go
