  Come on baby , Come on girl
  Come on baby , Come on girl
  I love you baby , I love you now
  I love you baby , I love you now

   Look at us, we're beautiful
   All the people push and pull but
   Let's just go out and ride
   Talk about the things we try

   Look at us, we're beautiful
   All the people push and pull but
   They'll never get inside
   We've got too much to hide
  
   Look at us we're beautiful
