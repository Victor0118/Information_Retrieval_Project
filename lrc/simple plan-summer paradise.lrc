  Oh, Oh
  Take me back, take me back
  Oh yeah
  Back to summer paradise
  My heart is sinking
  As I’m lifting up
  Above the clouds away from you
  And I can’t believe I’m leaving
  Oh I don’t kno-kno-know what I’m gonna do
  But someday
  I will find my way back
  To where your name
  Is written in the sand
  Cause I remember every sunset
  I remember every word you said
  We were never gonna say goodbye
  Say la-ta-ta-ta-ta
  Till we had to get back to
  Back to summer paradise with you
  And I’ll be there in a heartbeat
  Oh-oh
  I’ll be there in a heartbeat
  Oh-oh
  (Tell ’em)
  My soul is broken
  Streets are frozen
  I can’t stop these feelings melting through
  And I’d give away a thousand days, oh
  Just to have another one with you
  What’d you say
  Well relax can wait
  (relax can wait)
  I’m crushing my ways
  (uh-huh)
  Playing in the sand
  (me and you)
  Holding your hand
  Cause I remember every sunset
  I remember every word you said
  We were never gonna say goodbye
  Say la-ta-ta-ta-ta
  Till we had to get back to
  Back to summer paradise with you
  And I’ll be there in a heartbeat
  Oh-oh
  I’ll be there in a heartbeat
  Oh-oh
  Yeah I remember summer mornings
  And summer evenings
  Now you’re right next to me
  And I am freezing
  Was it real?
  Oh baby tell me, was I dreaming?
  How can you show me paradise,
  When I’m leaving?
  Now my heartbeat is sinking
  Hope’s shrinking
  When I try to speak no words
  Lip-syncing
  Hope this is not just wishful thinking
  Tell me that you care
  And I’ll be there in a heartbeat
  Someday
  I will find my way back
  To where your name
  Is written in the sand
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, let’s go
  Cause I remember every sunset
  I remember every word you said
  We were never gonna say goodbye
  Say la-ta-ta-ta-ta
  Till we had to get back to
  Back to summer paradise with you
  And I’ll be there in a heartbeat
  I remember where we first kissed
  How I didn’t wanna leave your lips
  And how I’ve never ever felt so high
  La-ta-ta-ta-ta
  Tell me how to get back to
  Back to summer paradise with you
  And I’ll be there in a heartbeat
  Oh-oh
  I’ll be there in a heartbeat
  (summer paradise)
  Oh-oh
  I’ll be there in a heartbeat
