 He said let's get out of this town, drive out of the city, away from the crowds.
 I thought heaven can't help me now, nothing lasts forever.
 But this is gonna take me down
 He's so tall, and handsome as hell
 He's so bad but he does it so well
 I can see the end as it begins, my one condition is…
 Say you'll remember me
 Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sun set, babe
 Red lips and rosy cheeks
 Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams
 Wildest dreams
 I say no one has to know what we do
 His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
 And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever
 But this is getting good now
 He's so tall, and handsome as hell
 He's so bad but he does it so well
 And when we've had our very last kiss, my last request is…
 Say you'll remember me
 Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sun set, babe
 Red lips and rosy cheeks
 Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams
 Wildest dreams
 You see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
 Burn it down
 Some day when you leave me
 I bet these memories hunt you around
 You see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
 Burn it down
 Some day when you leave me
 I bet these memories follow you around
 Say you'll remember me
 Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sun set, babe
 Red lips and rosy cheeks
 Say you'll see me again even if it's just pretend
 Say you'll remember me
 Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sun set, babe
 Red lips and rosy cheeks
 Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams
 Wildest dreams
 Even if it's just in your wildest dreams
 In your wildest dreams
