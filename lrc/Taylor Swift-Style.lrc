 Midnight, you come and pick me up
 No hidden lights
 
 Long drive
 But ending burn in flames or paradise
 
 Fading off you
 it's been a while since I have been heard from you
 
 I should just tell you to leave cause I
 Know exactly where it leads but I
 Watch us go round and round each time
 
 You got that James Dean day dream look in your eye
 And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
 And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time.
 Cause we never go out of style
 We never go out of style
 You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt.
 And I got that good girl thing and a tight little skirt
 And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time.
 Cause we never go out of style
 We never go out of style.
 
 So it goes
 He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
 
 Takes me home
 Lights are off, he's taking off his coat
 
 I say I heard that you been out and about with some other girl
 Some other girl
 
 He says, what you've heard it's true but I
 Can't stop thinking about you and I
 I said I've been there a few times
 
 Cause You got that James Dean day dream look in your eye
 And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
 And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time.
 Cause we never go out of style
 We never go out of style
 You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt.
 And I got that good girl thing and a tight little skirt,
 And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time.
 Cause we never go out of style
 We never go out of style.
 
 Take me home
 Just take me home
 Just take me home
 
 You got that James Dean day dream look in your eye
 And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
 And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time.
 Cause we never go out of style
 We never go out of style
