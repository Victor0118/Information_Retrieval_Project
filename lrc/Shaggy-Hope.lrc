 We had a one-room shack and the living was low
 And mama by herself, raised me and my bro.
 Wasn't easy but she did it with the little that flowed
 Worked hard got us off to school everyday
 Keep our eyes on the star though the skies were gray
 Gave us drive to survive really showed us the way
 Now I really understand what she was trying to say
  She said son there'll be times when the tides are high
  And the boat may be rocky, you can cry 
  Just never give up (you can never give up)
  In this life you can lead if you only believe
  In order to achieve what you need 
  You can never give up (you can never give up)
    And it's hope that keeps me holding on 
    It's just hope that makes me carry on 
 Home grown couldn't have made it alone
 I got a wonderful life, two kids of my own
 With a strong foundation that was carved in stone 
 Thank my mother for the love that made my house a home
 Makes me wonder sometimes if it was meant to be
 All this for a humble little guy like me
 All ever really wanted was a family
 Teach my kids the same values that she gave to me 
 We nah turn no stepper, things a go better
 Never let yourself be overcome by pressure
 Cool yah me bredda, have faith instead a
 Sid-dung and a watch and all a fight one another
 Blaze like fire,nah go retire 
 God nah sleep and a him inspire
 We fi reach higher a that him require
 Haffi mek we mark before the time expire
