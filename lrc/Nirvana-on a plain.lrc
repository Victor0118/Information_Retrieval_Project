 Without any words
 I got so high that
 I scratched 'til I bled
 Love myself
 Better than you
 I know it's wrong
 So what should I do?
 The finest day
 That I ever had
 Was when I learned
 To cry on command
 Love myself
 Better than you
 I know it's wrong
 So what should I do?
 I'm on a plain
 I can't complain
 I'm on a plain
 My mother died
 Every night
 It's safe to say
 Don't quote me on that
 Love myself
 Better than you
 I know it's wrong
 So what should I do?
 The black sheep got
 Blackmailed again
 Forgot to put
 On the zip code
 Love myself
 Better than you
 I know it's wrong
 So what should I do?
 I'm on a plain
 I can't complain
 I'm on a plain
 Somewhere I have heard this before
 In a dream my memory has stored
 As defense I'm neutered and spayed
 What the hell am I trying to say?
 It is now time
 To make it unclear
 To write off lines
 That don't make a sense
 Love myself
 Better than you
 I know it's wrong
 So what should I do?
 One more special
 Message to go
 And then I'm done
 And I can go home
 Love myself
 Better than you
 I know it's wrong
 So what should I do?
 I'm on a plain
 I can't complain
 I'm on a plain
 I can't complain
 I'm on a plain
 I can't complain
 I'm on a plain
 I can't complain
 I'm on aplain
 I can't complain
 I'm on aplain
