
Everybody plays the fool sometime; Theres no exception to the rule. Listen, baby, it may be factual, may be cruel, I aint lying, everybody plays the fool. Falling in love is such an easy thing to do, And theres no guarantee that the one you love is gonna love you. Oh, lovin eyes they cannot see a certain person could never be; Love runs deeper than any ocean, You can cloud your mind with emotion. Everybody plays the fool, sometime, They use your heart like a tool. Listen, baby, they never tell you so in school But everybody plays the fool. How can you help it when the music starts to play, And your ability to reason is swept away, Oh, heaven on earth is all you see; Youre out of touch with reality; Now you cry but when youre through The next time someone cries for you
