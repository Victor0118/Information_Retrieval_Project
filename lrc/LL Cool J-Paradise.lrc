 (feat. Amerie)
 
  
   10..
   Mm, MMM, mmm, mmm
 If you need me baby I'm, FOR, real
 The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise..
 If you want it baby just, BE, real
 The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise
 I'm gonna give-a-you all my love, yeah

 We went through this before
 Actin like the L's can't bag 'em no more
 Nightgown draggin on the heated marble floor
 Flash Cartier when you open up the door - slide these on baby
 So butter, still relate to the gutter
 Just your lifestyle's different, spirit uplifted
 Fell in love with a cat who's gifted
 Turn you back to paradise, damn I missed it
 Pop a bottle, light a purple candle
 I got somethin that you can't quite handle, that's why you love me
 Pour bubbly, glow from the flame make your skin shine lovely
 I'm sayin baby
 Touch it why don'tcha (ohh) touch it why don'tcha (ohh)
 Touch it why don'tcha (ayy) touch it why don'tcha (mmm)
 Hey girl.. aw, girl!
 Hey girl, I wanna rock your world

   If you need me baby I'm, FOR, real
   The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise..
   (Paradise, is very nice)
   If you want it baby just, BE, real
   The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise (uh, uh)
   I'm gonna give-a-you all my love, yeah

 Next phase is this
 Black sand, Tahiti, ten days to reminisce
 God's my witness (uh)
 I paid the price for paradise, so I'm livin this
 I never limit myself, the L's fearless
 Lay back while I illuminate the darkness
 Like it smooth don'tcha
 Make it move won'tcha, think I won't?
 Take you to your peak I know them other cats don't
 And it won't stop - this is beyond paper
 First I get your mind right, then I might drape ya
 Never pimpin, raise my girls well
 Young thoroughbreds get schoolled by Uncle L.L.
 C-double, L tattooed on the bubble
 I lay the mink down, let you walk over a puddle
 True love is so rare
 But don't you worry I ain't goin nowhere

 Trust me, trust me, trust - me, baby
 Rest of your life I'll take you to paradise
 I'll take you to paradise, oooohh
 So won't you try me, try me - try, this, lady
 Rest of your life I'll take you to paradise
 I'm gonna give-a-you all my love, yeah

 Belly to belly, one hand on the jelly
 At the telly on the celly - get that money Elle
 Please believe it, if the mind can conceive it
 then the man can achieve it; you gotta breathe it
 And I breathe deep, I'm one with the universe
 Minimum, ten percent go to God first
 Lay back baby, close your eyes
 Ice on the pinky finger froze your thighs
 So much shade baby, the waterbed fries
 Walk around nude in the suite yellin, "Recognize!"
 Do your dance, baby pour me a class
 It feels so good to have the world in a smash
 Touch it why don'tcha (ohh) touch it why don'tcha (ohh)
 Touch it why don'tcha (ayy) touch it why don'tcha (mmm)
 Hey girl.. aw, girl!
 Hey girl, I wanna rock your world

  
 Yea yea, gotta keep your eyes on the prize baby
 Sky's the limit
 If you can see it, you can be it
 Ha ha, it's on you, word up
 Everybody put your hands in the air
 It's high time baby
 One love, one God, recognize, uhh

 (If you need me), just call me
 Said if you want me, just be for reallll
 And if you like me, come and talk to me
 And if you want me, tell me how you feeelll

 If you need me baby I'm, FOR, real
 The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise..
 (Paradise, is very nice)
