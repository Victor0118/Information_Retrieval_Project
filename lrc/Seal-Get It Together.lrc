 ---Seal---
 Now's the time for stepping out of place
 Get up on your feet and 
 give account of your faith
 Pray to God or something 
 or whatever you do
 
 What I see can make me stop and stare
 But who am I to judge the color of your hair
 Surely all you're feeling 
 much the same as I do
 We got to keep this world together, 
 got to keep it moving straight
 Love like we need forever, 
 so that people can relate
 If you're rolling to your left,
 don't forget I'm on the right
 Trust and forgive each other
 A little love and we just might
 Yeah, yeah
 
 We gotta do something, we gotta do something, 
 we gotta do something
 Thinking of the troubles of today 
 is it easier to put that gun away
 Or is it difficult 
 to stop the world to show you care
 
 Everything, everyone we know is beautiful
 Surely you will be 
 the guide in light to see us all
 Maybe we can be the vision 
 of a perfect man's dream
 
 We got to keep this world together, 
 got to keep it moving straight
 Love like we need forever, 
 so that people can relate
 If you're rolling to your left,
 don't forget I'm on the right
 Trust and forgive each other
 A little love and we just might
 just might
 I have something, do you 
 have something 'cause I 
 have something for you
 I have something, do you 
 have something 'cause I 
 have something for you
 I have something, do you 
 have something 'cause I 
 have something for you
 I have something for you
 We got to keep this world together, 
 got to keep it moving straight
 Love like we need forever, 
 so that people can relate
 If you're rolling to your left,
 don't forget I'm on the right
 Trust and forgive each other
 A little love and we just might
 We got to keep this world together, 
 got to keep it moving straight
 Love like we need forever, 
 so that people can relate
 If you're rolling to your left,
 don't forget I'm on the right
 Trust and forgive each other
 A little love and we just might
