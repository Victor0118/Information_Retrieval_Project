 Somewhere over the rainbow
 Way up high
 There's a land that I heard of
 Once in a lullaby
 Some day I'll wish upon a star
 And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
 Where troubles melt like lemondrops
 Away above the chimney tops
 That's where you'll find me
 Somewhere over the rainbow
 Bluebirds fly
 Birds fly over the rainbow
 Then why , oh why can't I?
 Why can't I?
