      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Birthday Girl - Matt Nathanson . Early morning, autumn light. Whitewashed walls and children playing. The air is still, I smell the bakery. . Lying here in last night's clothes, Mexican girls in Sunday dresses Fill the sidewalks up Guerrero street. . Save me, I get lost so easy. C'mon and lift the fog, my birthday girl. The rains came, turned all the hills green, Turned the dirt to flowers, birthday girl. My birthday girl. . Just because you learn to breathe Underwater doesn't mean You ever shake The fear of being drowned. . Between the sparks and junkyard thoughts, The things I stole, the things I lost, You could build a city in my head. In my head. . Save me, I get lost so easy. C'mon and lift the fog, my birthday girl. The rains came, turned all the hills green, Turned my dirt to flowers, birthday girl. . I don't know what to do Once this gets started. I never meant to be so Broken-hearted. . Save me, I get lost so easy. Turn my dirt to flowers, birthday girl. My birthday girl. .  Save me, I get lost so easy. C'mon and lift the fog, my birthday girl. The rains came, turned all the hills green, Turned my dirt to flowers, birthday girl. . I don't know what to do Once this gets started. I never meant to be so Broken-hearted. . Save me, c'mon just save me. Turn my dirt to flowers, birthday girl. My birthday girl. . 歌词编辑：活在當下     QQ：6313827
