 And the road is lookin' long,
 And the only thing that comes to mind
 Is the tune of this sad song.
 Tune of this sad song! Oh Lord!
 
 Well, the wind is acreepin' up my back,
 Through the door, through the roof,
 through the window crack.
 Tossin' and a-turnin' all night long
 To the rhythm and the sound of a saddened song.
 Saddened song! Oh Lord!
 
 In a dream of passion I saw a face
 Of a beautiful woman in a terrible place.
 She looked at me, and she called for you,
 Then she closed her eyes and she sang this tune.
 Sang this tune! Oh Lord
