 I don’t know, but I believe
 That some things are meant to be
 And that you’ll make a better me
 Everyday I love you
 I never thought that dreams came true
 But you showed me that they do
 You know that I learn somethng new
 Everyday I love you
 ’Cos I believe that destiny
 Is out of our control (don’t you know that I do)
 And you’ll never live until you love
 With all your heart and soul.
 It’s a touch when I feel bad
 It’s a smile when I get mad
 All the little things I am
 Everyday I love you
 Everyday I love you boy
 Everyday I love you
 ’Cos I believe that destiny
 Is out of our control (don’t you know that I do)
 And you’ll never live until you love
 With all your heart and soul
 If I asked would you say yes?
 Together we’re the very best
 I know that I am truly blessed
 Everyday I love you
 And I’ll give you my best
 Everyday I love you
