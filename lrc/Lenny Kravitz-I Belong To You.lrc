 
 
 
 
 
 You are the flame in my heart
 You light my way in the dark
 You are the ultimate star
 
 You lift me up from above
 Your unconditional love takes me to paradise
 
   I belong to you
  And you
  You belong to me too
 
 You make my life complete
 You make me feel so sweet
 
 You make me feel so divine
 Your soul and mind are entwined
 Before you I was blind
 
 But since I’ve opened my eyes
 And with you there’s no disguise
 So I could open up my mind
 
 I always loved you from the start
 But I could not figure out
 That I had to do it everyday
 So I put away the fight
 Now I’m gonna live my life
 Giving you the most in every way
 
   Ooo I belong to you
    And you
   You belong to me too
      You make my life complete
    You make me feel so sweet
