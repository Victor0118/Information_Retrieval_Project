     The Last Time(feat.Gary Lightbody) - Taylor Swift  lyric By 潇风寒月 QQ:395254794  Found myself at your door, Just like all those times before, I'm not sure how I got there, All roads they lead me here. I imagine you are home, In your room, all alone, And you open your eyes into mine, And everything feels better, Right before your eyes, I'm breaking, no past No reasons why, Just you and me.  This is the last time I'm asking you this, Put my name at the top of your list, This is the last time I'm asking you why, You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.  You find yourself at my door, Just like all those times before, You wear your best apology, But I was there to watch you leave, And all the times I let you in, Just for you to go again, Disappear when you come back, Everything is better. Right before your eyes, I'm aching, run fast Nowhere to hide, Just you and me…  This is the last time I'm asking you this, Put my name at the top of your list, This is the last time I'm asking you why, You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye…  This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong, This is the last time I say it's been you all along, This is the last time I let you in my door, This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore. Oh, oh, oh,  This is the last time I'm asking you this, Put my name at the top of your list, This is the last time I'm asking you why, You break my heart in the blink of an eye.  This is the last time I'm asking you this (this is the last time I'm asking you this) Put my name at the top of your list (put my name on the top of your list) This is the last time I'm asking you why (this is the last time I'm asking you why) You break my heart in the blink of an eye (You break my heart…) This is the last time I'm asking you, Last time I'm asking you, Last time I'm asking you this... This is the last time I'm asking you, Last time I'm asking you, Last time I'm asking you this... This is the last time I'm asking you, Last time I'm asking you, Last time I'm asking you this...  This is the last time I'm asking you, Last time I'm asking you, Last time I'm asking you this...  歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com
