 (Open up man) What do you want man?
 (My girl just caught me)
 You let her catch you?
 (I don't know how I let this happen)
 With who?
 (The girl next door, you know?) Man...
 (I don't know what to do) Say it wasn't you
 (Alright)
     Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
    Creeping with the girl next door
    Picture this we were both butt-naked
    Banging on the bathroom floor
  00:29.92]How could I forget
   That I had given her an extra key
   All this time she was standing there
   She never took her eyes off me
 How 
  you can grant the woman access to your villa
 Trespasser and a witness while you cling on your pillow
 You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
 Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner
 To be a true player you have to know how to play
 If she say you're not, convince her say you're gay
 Never admit to a word when she say makes a claim
 And you tell her baby no way
   But she caught me on the counter
  (It wasn't me)
  Saw me banging on the sofa
  (It wasn't me)
  I even had her in the shower
  (It wasn't me)
  She even caught me on camera
  (It wasn't me)
  She saw the marks on my shoulder
  (It wasn't me)
  Heard the words that I told her
  (It wasn't me)
  Heard the screams getting louder
  (It wasn't me)
  She stayed until it was over
 I had tried to keep her from what she was about to see
 Why should she believe me when I told her it wasn't me
 Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on
 Da right prefix whenever you should see her make da giggolo flex
 As funny as it be by you, it not that complex
 Seein' is believin' so you better change your specs
 You know she not gonna be worrying bout things from the past
 Hardly recollecting and then she'll go to noontime mass
 Your answer: go over there but if she pack a gun
 You know you better run fast
 Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
 I've been listenin' to your reasonin'
 It makes no sense at all
 We should tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
 You may think that you're a player
 But you're completely lost
