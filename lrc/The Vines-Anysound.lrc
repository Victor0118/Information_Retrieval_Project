 I am a Vine
 All twisted and frayed
 Lookin' for light
 A million ways
 
 Time hangin' around
 Been getting' me down now baby yeah
 Show me any sound
 Kill me now I'm dead
 
 Keep for yourself
 Or throw it away
 Damage your health
 Or manage your brain
 
  Time hangin' around
  Been getting' me down now baby yeah
  Show me any sound
  Kill me now I'm dead
