      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Earthquake Weather - Matt Nathanson . I'd kill anyone who'd treat you as bad as I do I'd love to believe it all works out A July 4th parade wrapped up in beach towels Under a fireworks display . I close my eyes And I dream about you, dream about you Sun so bright You're just a shadow fading out And it feels like summer But it's earthquake It's earthquake weather It feels like summer But it's earthquake It's earthquake weather . Scared dogs will bite Cowards cut and run The sun burns your skin It comes natural To be so cruel To be an asshole To someone as good as you . I close my eyes And I dream about you, dream about you Sun so bright And I'm just a shadow fading out And it feels like summer But it's earthquake It's earthquake weather It feels like summer But it's earthquake It's earthquake weather . I close my eyes  And I dream about you Sun still shines I'm just a shadow fading out And it feels like summer But it's earthquake It's earthquake weather It feels like summer But it's earthquake It's earthquake weather . feels like  It feels like summer earthquake  It's earthquake weather feels like  It feels like summer earthquake  It feels like forever Forever I'd kill anyone who'd treat you as bad as I do . 歌词编辑：活在當下     QQ：6313827
