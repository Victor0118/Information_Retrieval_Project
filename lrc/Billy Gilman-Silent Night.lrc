 Silent night, holy night
 All is calm, all is bright
 Round yon virgin mother and child
 Holy infant so tender and mild
 Sleep in heavenly peace
 Sleep in heavenly peace
 
 Silent night, holy night
 Son of God, love's pure light
 Radiant beams from thy holy face
 With the dawn of redeeming grace
 Christ, the Savior is born
 Christ, the Savior is born
 
 Christ, the Savior is born
