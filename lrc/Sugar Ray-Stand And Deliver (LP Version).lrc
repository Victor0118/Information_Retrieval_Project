     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Stand And Deliver (LP Version) - Sugar Ray Stand and deliver  I'm the dandy highwayman who you're too scared to mention I spend my cash on looking flash and grabbing your attention The devil take your stereo and your record collection  The way you look you'll qualify for next year's old age pension Stand and deliver your money or your life!  Try and use a mirror no bullet or a knife!  I'm the dandy highwayman so sick of easy fashion The clumsy boots, peek-a-boo roots that people think so dashing So what's the point of robbery when nothing is worth taking? It's kind of tough to tell a scruff the big mistake he's making Stand and deliver your money or your life!  Try and use a mirror no bullet or a knife! And even though you fool your souls Your conscience will be mine all mine  We're the dandy highwaymen so tired of excuses Of deep meaning philosophies where only showbiz loses We're the dandy highwaymen, here's our invitation "Throw your safety overboard and join our insect nation" Stand and deliver your money or your life!  Try and use a mirror no bullet or a knife!  And even though you fool your souls Your conscience will be mine, all mine Da diddley qa qa, da diddley qa qa Da diddley qa qa, da diddley qa qa Da diddley qa qa, da diddley qa qa Da diddley qa qa, da diddley qa qa Stand  and deliver your money or your life!  Stand and deliver your money or your life!  Stand and deliver your money or your life!  Stand and deliver your money or your life!  Stand and deliver your money or your life! 陈先生 QQ：1552195557
