 (feat. Holly Brook and Jonah Matranga)
 
 Where'd you go?
 I miss you so,
 Seems like it's been forever,
 That you've been gone.
 
 She said "Some days I feel like shit,
 Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit,"
 I don't understand why you have to always be gone,
 I get along but the trips always feel so long,
 And, I find myself tryna stay by the phone,
 'Cause your voice always helps me when I feel so alone,
 But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call,
 But when I pick up I don't have much to say,
 So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up,
 That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin',
 Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career,
 Me and the rest of the family here singing "Where'd you go?"
 I miss you so,
 Seems like it's been forever,
 That you've been gone.
 Where'd you go?
 I miss you so,
 Seems like it's been forever,
 That you've been gone,
 Please come back home...
 You know the place where you used to live,
 Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs,
 Used to have a little party every Hallowe'en with candy by the pile,
 But now, you only stop by every once in a while,
 Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time,
 Anything to keep the thought of you from my mind,
 I'm doin' fine, I plan to keep it that way,
 You can call me if you find you have somethin' to say,
 And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up,
 That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin',
 Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career,
 Me and the rest of the family here singing "Where'd you go?"
 I miss you so,
 Seems like it's been forever,
 That you've been gone.
 Where'd you go?
 I miss you so,
 Seems like it's been forever,
 That you've been gone,
 Please come back home...
 I want you to know it's a little fucked up,
 That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin',
 Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses,
 For while you're not around, and feeling so useless,
 It seems one thing has been true all along,
 You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone,
 I guess I've had it with you and your career,
 When you come back I won't be here and you'll can sing it...
 Where'd you go?
 I miss you so,
 Seems like it's been forever,
 That you've been gone.
 Where'd you go?
 I miss you so,
 Seems like it's been forever,
 That you've been gone,
 Please come back home...
 Please come back home...
 Please come back home...
 Please come back home...
 Please come back home...
