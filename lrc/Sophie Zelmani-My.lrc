My mind is just where you are, you are, you are.
And I'm tired of going that far.
My heart beats so fast, so fast, so fast.
Please slow it down so it will last.
My dreams always always always confuse.
They are to no use.
I'm going, going, going nowhere not until you're here.
My life is giving, giving, giving back to me all reasons to be.
My love is so hard, so hard, so hard to feel and it won't ever leave
