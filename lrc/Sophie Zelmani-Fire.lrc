You don't know of the strings you're pulling.
They've been hanging loose on me.
I go crazy when I feel them moving
cause' it reminds me I don't let you be free.

I'll go through a fire for this.
I'll go all the way and hope
there's a loophole we've missed.

My name can't live up to this matter
So don't say it if you don't want what it will bring.
And if you are scared of this dirty weather
I think you should rush off for your thing.

I'll be in the fire for you.
My senses don't work so well when I'm hurt
but I've said I love you.

I'll be in the fire for you.
I'll wait in the fire and I will hope
I'm still there when you're through.
