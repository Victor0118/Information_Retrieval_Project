     www.lrcgc.com The Lover After Me(Live) - Savage Garden Here I go again' I promised myself  I wouldn't think of you today  It's been seven months and counting You've moved on I still feel exactly the same  It's just that everywhere I go all the buildings know your name Like photographs and memories of love  Steel and granite reminders The city calls your name and I can't move on  Ever since you've been gone The lights go out the same The only difference is You call another name To your love To your lover now To your love The lover after me  Am I all alone in the universe?  There's no love on these streets  I have given mine away to a world that didn't want it anyway  So this is my new freedom  It's funny I don't remember being chained  But nothing seems to make sense anymoreWithout you  Ever since you've been gone The lights go out the same The only difference is You call another name To your love To your lover now To your love The lover after me  And time goes by so slowly  The nights are cold and lonely I shouldn't be holding on But I'm still holding on for you  Here I go again I promised myself I wouldn't think of you today  But I'm standing at your doorway  I'm calling out your name because I can't move on  Ever since you've been gone The lights go out the same The only difference is You call another name To your love To your lover now  To your love The lover after me Ever since you've been gone The lights go out the same The only difference is You call another name To your love To your lover now To your love The lover after me
