 If you wanna go and take a ride wit me
 wit three women in the fo' with the gold D's
 Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
 If you wanna go and get high wit me
 Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-y
 Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
 In the club on the late night, feelin right
 Lookin tryin to spot somethin real nice
 Lookin for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
 (I can take home)
 She can be 18 (18) wit an attitude
 or 19 kinda snotty actin real rude
 But as long as you a thicky thicky thick girl you know that it's on
 (Know that it's on)
 I peep something comin towards me on the dance floor
 Sexy and real slow (hey)
 Sayin she was peepin and I dig the last video
 So when Nelly, can we go; how could I tell her no?
 Her measurements were 36-25-34
 I like the way you brush your hair
 And I like those stylish clothes you wear
 I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
 And I can see you boo from way over there
 If you wanna go and take a ride wit me
 wit three women in the fo' with the gold D's
 Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
 If you wanna go and get high wit me
 Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-y
 Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
 Face and body front and back, don't know how to act
 Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringin nuttin back
 You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
 when the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
 Watch me as I gas that, fo' dot six Range
 Watch the candy paint change, everytime I switch lanes
 It feel strange now
 Makin a livin off my brain, instead of 'caine now
 I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
 Damn shit done changed now
 Runnin credit checks with no shame now
 I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
 Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
 I'm gettin pages out of New Jersey, from Courtney B.
 Tellin me about a party up in NYC
 And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
 Payin cash; first class - sittin next to Vanna White
 If you wanna go and take a ride wit me
 wit three women in the fo' with the gold D's
 Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
 If you wanna go and get high wit me
 Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-y
 Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

 Check, check -- yo, I know somethin you don't know
 And I got somethin to tell ya
 You won't believe how many people, straight doubted the flow
 Most said that I was a failure
 But now the same motherfuckers askin me fo' dough
 And I'm yellin, "I can't help ya"
 "But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?"
 Hell no (what's witchu?!) you for real?!
 Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
 Niggaz wanna know why, why I fly by
 But yo it's all good, Range Rover all wood
 Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
 We be them stud niggaz, wishin you was niggaz
 Poppin like we drug dealers, simply cause she butt-naked
 Honey in the club, me in the Benz
 Icy grip, tellin me to leave wit you and your friends
 So if shorty wanna... knock, we knockin to this
 And if shorty wanna... rock, we rockin to this
 And if shorty wanna... pop, we poppin the Crist'
 Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
 City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
 When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
 See the ice and the glist'; niggaz starin or they diss
 Honies lookin all they wish - come on boo, gimme kiss
 If you wanna go and take a ride wit me
 wit three women in the fo' with the gold D's
 Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
