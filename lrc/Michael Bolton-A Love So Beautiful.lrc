 (Music)
 The summer sun went down on
 Our love long ago
 But in my heart I feel the same
 Old afterglow
 
   A love so beautiful
   In every way
    A love so beautiful
    We let it slip away
 
 We were too young to understand
 To ever know
 That lovers drift apart
 And that's the way love goes
 
 A love so beautiful
 A love so free
 A love so beautiful
 A love for you and me
 
  And when I think of you
  I fall in love again
 
 End
