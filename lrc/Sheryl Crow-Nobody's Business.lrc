      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Nobody's Business - Sheryl Crow . It’s getting late again tonight And maybe you should just spend the night But it ain’t wrong as long as we think it’s alright . But you don’t have to park a block away Or sneak out before the break of day But if the neighbors see you who cares anyway? . It’s nobody’s business what we do Let em all talk if they want to It’s nobody’s business if I love you Oh and I love you Like nobody’s business . Gossip makes the world go round Especially in this stupid town Somebody’s probably driving by talking trash right now . It’s nobody’s business what we do Let em all talk if they want to It’s nobody’s business if I love you Oooooooooooh Oooooooooooh Yea I’m gonna love you Like nobody’s business . It’s nobody’s business what we do Let em all talk if they want to It’s nobody’s business if I love you Oh and baby I do Oooooooooooh Oh and I’m gonna love you baby Like nobody’s business .  Let em talk, let em talk Oh yea Let em all talk yea As long as they don’t know it’s us . 歌词编辑：活在當下     QQ：6313827
