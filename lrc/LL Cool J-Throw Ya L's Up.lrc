 Uhh, hot, fire, hot, uhh

 
 L!!! Who bring you the hotness?
 L!!! Yo, you don't wanna start with
 L!!! Forever keepin it locked
 It's now time to rock with - L!!! - throw your L's up

 
 Don't ever underestimate the Jack the Ripper
 Be clear, every time he reappears, it's sicker
 Listen here, the mind expanded, the vision is slicker
 I'm long range like a miss-ile, many styles to getcha
 Tear ya out the frame so the hood can get the picture
 But I'd rather break bread, kick knowledge and get some money witcha
 I'm willin and able, to smooth pounds out like Witch Hazel
 The legend is real, I'm not a fable
 Captivated the screen, I'm Queens' Clark Gable
 If it ain't a joint, bet your label, don't put it on the table
 I'm out for the moolah, throw better hooks than David Tua
 Who's the nicest? (L, YOU ARE!!)

 
  L!!! Who bring you the hotness?
  L!!! Yo, you don't wanna start with
  L!!! Forever keepin it locked
  It's now time to rock with - L!!! - throw your L's up

 
 You don't want it with L, b'ship cats'll get banged out
 Put your flow throw a filter boy - shake the old slang out
 23's in the building, watch my tongue hang out
 Makin MC's scatter like multiple shots rang out
 Day one since I came out, they can't put the flame out
 My temp seizin, perfect reason to blow the game out
 Skatin off in the Navi, naw baby you can't have me
 But I know cats will pay for that 'n lace ya - yeah, gladly
 Warning, young rappers, you don't want a career?
 Y'all wanna keep goin platinum, y'all don't wanna disappear?
 Stop boppin backstage like you causin me fear
 Cause you startin to get on my nerves, and that's a problem
 The vet's in here

 
  L!!! Who bring you the hotness?
  L!!! Yo, you don't wanna start with
  L!!! Forever keepin it locked
  It's now time to rock with - L!!! - throw your L's up

 
 Tension on the mic, halftime highlights
 L Boogie bangin on 'em, jumpin through the skylight
 You stand corrected, I'm hot, so get it riddight
 I'm just spittin, when the middick is gripped, I spit it tiddight
 Aight? Oh, these various rappers is so hilarious
 Who put the mic down but y'all ain't qualified to carry this
 Your, tracks are garbage and bars are miscellaneous
 So, throwin your joint at my car was spontaneous
 Oh! I can't take it, why, must they fake it
 Flows is fully dressed, yours is butt naked
 Forever I will be, the one they came to see
 Blowin mics in half baby, who else could it be but

 
    L!!! Who bring you the hotness?
    L!!! Yo, you don't wanna start with
    L!!! Forever keepin it locked
    It's now time to rock with - L!!! - throw your L's up

 
 Uhh, I'm so hot (yeah)
 We so hot (yeah)
 Uhh, uhh, you so hot (I'm so hot)
 Uhh, uhh, feel it hot (yeah)
 Uhh, uhh, are you hot (you make me hot)
 Uhh, uhh, I know I'm hot (oooh)
 Uhh, uhh, are you hot (yes I'm hot)
 Uhh, uhh, I know I'm hot - feel it! (yeah)
