 Album: Some Hearts

  Where 69 meets 40
 There's a single stop light town
 And back when I was really young
 A part of that burned down
 On any given Friday night
 We'd drive a hundred miles
 Between the Sonic and the Grocery Store
 Laughing all the while
 With as many friends as I could pack
 In my daddy's Ford
   But I ain't in Checotah anymore
 My hotel in Manhattan
 Holds more people than our town
 And what I just paid for dinner
 Would be a down payment on a house
 I'd rather be tipping cows in Tulsa
 Then hailing cabs here in New York
   I'm in a world so wide
   It makes me feel small sometimes
   I miss the big blue sky
   The Oklahoma kind
 In a world of long red carpets
 The bright lights of Hollywood
 All the paparazzi flashing
 Could make a girl feel pretty good
 You can get anything you want here
 Except a Wal-Mart store
 Where the Wildcats beat the Ironheads
 Old Settler's day and the Okra fest
 After prom, down at the bowling lanes
 Catching crappie fish in Eufaula Lake
 I ain't in Checotah anymore
 Oh, yeah
 But I ain't in Checotah
 No I ain't in Checotah
 Oh, there's nothing like Oklahoma
 There's a single stoplight town
