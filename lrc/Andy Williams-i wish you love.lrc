 Goodbye, no use leading with our chins
 This is where our story ends
 Never lovers, ever friends
 Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day
 But before you walk away
 I sincerely want to say
 
 Baby,I wish you love！
 I wish you bluebirds in the spring 
 to give your heart a song to sing
 And then a kiss but more than this
 I wish you love
 And in July a lemonade 
 to cool you in some leafy glade
 I wish you health and more than wealth
 I wish you love
 My breaking heart and I agree
 that you and I could never be
 So with my best  my very best 
 I set you free
 I wish you shelter from the storm
 A cozy fire to keep you warm
 But most of all 
 when snowflakes fall 
 I wish you love
 My breaking heart and I agree 
 that you and I could never be
 So with my best, my very best,
 I set you free
 I wish you shelter from the storm
 A cozy fire to keep you warm
 But most of all 
 when snowflakes fall
 I wish you love
 when snowflakes fall
 I wish you love
 when snowflakes fall
 I wish you love
