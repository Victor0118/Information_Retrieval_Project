     treacherous taylor swift 歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Put your lips close to mine As long as they don't touch Out of focus out of eye Till the gravity is too much And I'll do anything you say If you say it with your hands And I'll be smart to walk away but you're quizzing  This love is Treacherous This path is reckless This love is Treacherous And I I I like it  I can't decide if it's a choice Getting swept away I hear the sound of my own voice Asking you to stay And all we are is skin and bone trained to get along Forever going with the flow but you friction  This love is Treacherous This path is reckless This love is Treacherous I I I like it  Somwhere like sharp to the sleepless night And I will get will get you alone Your name has echoed through my mind And I just think you should think you should know Them not being safe is worth the driving I will follow you follow you home I follow you follow you home  This hope is Treacherous This day dream is dangerous This hope is Treacherous I I I , I I I, I I I Somwhere like sharp to the sleepless night And I will get will get you alone Your name has echoed through my mind And I just think you should think you should know Them not being safe is worth the driving I will follow you follow you home I follow you follow you home I follow you follow you home I follow you follow you home  This love is Treacherous I I I like it
