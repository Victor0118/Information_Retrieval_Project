 ]    歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Hold It Against Me   - Britney Spears if I said I want your body Would you hold it against me  Hey over there Please forgive me If i'm coming on too strong Hate to stare But you're winning And they're playing my favorite song  So come in  little closer Wanna whisper in your ear Make it clear Little question  Wanna note just how you feel If I said my heart was beating loud If we could escape the crowd some how  If I said I want your body now  Would you hold it against me Cause you feel like paradise And I need a vacation tonight  So if I said I want your body now Would you hold it against me Hey you might think That I'm crazy But you know I'm just your type I might be Little hazy  But you just cannot deny  There's a spark Inbetween us When we're dancin' on the floor I want more Wanna see it So I'm askin' you tonight If I said my heart was beating loud If we could escape the crowd some how If I said I want your body now Would you hold it against me  Cause you feel like paradise And I need a vacation tonight So if I said I want your body now  Would you hold it against me  if I said I want your body Would you hold it against me  Gimme something good Don't wanna wait I want it now  Drop it like a hood And show me how you work it out  If I said my heart was beating loud  If I said I want your body now Would you hold it against me  If I said my heart was beating loud If we could escape the crowd some how If I said I want your body now  Would you hold it against me Cause you feel like paradise And I need a vacation tonight So if I said I want your body now Would you hold it against me 陈先生  QQ:1552195557
