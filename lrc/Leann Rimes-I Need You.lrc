 LeAnn Rimes
   
 I don't need a lot of things
 I can get by with nothing
 Of all the blessings life can bring
 I've always needed something
 But I've got all I want
 When it comes to loving you
 You're my only reason
 You're my only truth
   I need you like water
   Like breath, like rain
   I need you like mercy
   From heaven's gate
   There's a freedom in your arms
   That carries me through
     I need you
 You're the hope that moves me
 To courage again
 You're the love that rescues me
 When the cold winds, rage
 And it's so amazing
 'Cause that's just how you are
 And I can't turn back now
 'Cause you've brought me too far
  Oh yes I do
 by lune
 THE END
