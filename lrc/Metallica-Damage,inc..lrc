 Charging hard and no ones gonna give in
 Living on your knees, conformity
 Or dying on your feet for honesty
 Inbred, our bodies work as one
 Bloody, but never cry submission
 Following our instinct not a trend
 Go against the grain until the end 
 Blood will follow blood
 Dying time is here
 Damage Incorporated 
 
 Slamming through, dont fuck with razorback
 Stepping out? Youll feel our hell on your back
 Blood follows blood and we make sure
 Life aint for you and were the cure
 Honesty is my only excuse
 Try to rob us of it, but its no use
 Steamroller action crushing all
 Victim is your name and you shall fall 
 Blood will follow blood
 Dying time is here
 Damage Incorporated 
 
 We chew and spit you out
 We laugh, you scream and shout
 All flee, with fear you run
 Youll know just where we come from 
 Damage Incorporated 
 
 Damage jackals ripping right through you
 Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin
 Know just how to get just what we want
 Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
 Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
 Never happy ending on these dark sets
 Alls fair for Damage Inc. you see
 Step a little closer if you please 
 Blood will follow blood
 Dying time is here
 Damage Incorporated
