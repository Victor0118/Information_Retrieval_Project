     Love Will Save The Day 演唱：Boyzone  Lrc制作:潇风寒月 QQ:395254794  She is to the broken hearts To the ones that love, the ones that have the losing cards He is to the sweet unknown To the tails untold, let the night unfold and the stars above Pass around the bottle And tell me your troubles And la la la la la la love will save the day Yea pass around the bottle And I’ll share your troubles And la la la la la la love will save the day Really undecided We’re the ones who tried to find our way Gotta find your promise Gonna watch the night go up in flames Pass around the bottle And we’ll share our troubles and La la la la la la love will save the day friends come and gather round Throw your hands up high to the silent sky we’re the answer is found Let laughter fill the air Forget your worries, carry on without a care Pass around the bottle And I’ll share your troubles And la la la la la la love will save the day Really undecided We’re the ones who tried to find our way Gotta find your promise Gonna watch the night go up in flames Let me ease your every heart and Fill it up with joy Let the storm and seas departed Let it guide you home Pass around the bottle And we’ll share our troubles La la la la la la love will save the day Really undecided We’re the ones who tried to find our way Gotta find your promise Gonna watch the night go up in flames Pass around the bottle And we’ll share our troubles Sing la la la la la la love will save the day Pass around the bottle And we’ll share our troubles Sing la la la la la la love will save the day Sing la la la la la la love will save the day  歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com
