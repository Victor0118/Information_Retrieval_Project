Everybody in the house now (whoot, whoot) 
La fiesta (whoot, whoot) 

If I approach you correctly 
And step up to you respectfully 
Will you please ma'am bless me with the next dance? 
I don't intend to offend you 
I only intend to befriend you 
But you're willing me, thrilling me, killing me 
With those hot pants, not a chance 
I'mma let you go without saying something 
A little hotter in the bottom mama that's all that I'm wanting 
No frontin' if it is illegal for you to be that fine 
I be McGruff mama taking a bite out of crime 
Literally, first it'll be dancing with me 
Then it'll be dinner with me 
Then it'll be back to my crib 
Hold up, I'm about to get ahead of myself 
And I'm playing myself 
The type of brother that when I'm thinking of stuff 
I'm saying the stuff 
My bad, back it up let's start with a dance 
On good behavior, maybe later 
Maybe your apartment, your pad 
Sike, joke, walking a tight rope 
My foot in my mouth 
Look, all I hope is that you'll dance with me 
What's up? 

Repeat 1 

She was smiling I was kind wiling 
Thinking I was dialin' in 
She gave me the impression that she was getting my message 
So I'm testing 
I through it out there ‘Let me buy you a drink' 
Cause when I buy you I think it'd be fly if we link 
What'cha think? 
She responded with a grin and a glance 
Then my eyes tried to seduce her to the forbidden dance 
The body of a Latin goddess, sexy but modest 
The hottest mami chula from Cuba, a cutie with promise 
The other night I seen her dancing 
Duty was over 
She did a split into a spin 
And put her leg on his shoulder 
And he was over 
If that was me and I was he 
We'd probably still be dancing 
Mami can you feel me? 
Still she said nothing 
Why she be fronting? 
Never seen another mami move like you 
Groove like you 
I'm saying I wanna dance with you 
What's up? 

Repeat 1 

To me when I'm dancing it's aphrodisiatic 
It's automatic that I look in your eyes to help fantasize 
Some people dance socially not emotionally 
Closer to me, come on close as you can be 
(Can you feel me?) 
Come on mama cut me no slack 
(Can you feel me?) 
Come on mama forward and back 
(Can you feel me?) 
Come on mama as hard as you can 
It's part of the plan 
It happens when you start with the man 
On your mark, ready set, baby let's go 
Baby let's flow, baby let go 
Baby no, no, gotta a lot more 
Lettin' it rip, gimme some of that 
*girl yells* 
Yeah that's it 
Sweatin' with me, getting it wetter with me 
It's better with me 
Gain it, other girls I dated ain't famous 
So take it or leave it 
Just the way that I eat it 
I bring, I swing it 
So you like that? 
Tell me what's up 

Repeat 1 till end
