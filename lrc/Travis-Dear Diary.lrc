 From Album "The Invisible Band"
 Track 2
 
 Dear Diary,
 What is wrong with me?
 'Cos I'm fine between the lines.
 
 Be not afraid.
 Help is on its way.
 A sentence suspended in air,
 way over there.
 
 Dear Diary,
 What else could it be?
 As nightshade descends like a veil,
 under the sail of my heart.
 Be still, don't stop until the end.
 
 Dear Diary,
 What is wrong with me?
 'Cos I'm fine between the lines.
