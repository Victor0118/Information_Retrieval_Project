Will Smith f/ Rodney Jerkins, MC Lyte, & Tatyana Ali 
  
Darkchild, Big Will, 2000 
Bust out, shake it up now 
Come on, come on 
And shake it up now 
Who am I? 
You know, you know 
Big Will, ya ready? 
Come on 

  
When I was a lad I used to dream that (one day) 
I''d earned the cream that make phat rocks gleam 
Phat rhymes to make it seem that I was like Bill Gates 
Writing lines, seal fates 
Power to change the whole set 
For exposure or forfeit 
And with the wicked sense on how to get the picket fence 
Envisioned a hot life, hot wife 
Wanted a crib, well a palace like South Fork on Dallas 
With lights simmer trees for the ambiance 
I been up and down and high and low 
Fly with dough, broke looking grimy yo 
My shiny glow definitely ain''t cause of my Bentley 
It''s something that my fam put in me 
Who am I? You ask 
The guy with the razzmatazz with ten duffel bags packed with pazazz 
In the past cut twice by the ladies of my life 
Boom stitched up by my wife 
Who am I? 
It''s suffice to say found gold in my heart 
Put the ice away 
Nicer day, live foul homie it''s a price to pay 
Even when it''s rainy still I say it''s nice to day 
Who am I? 
That brother with the platinum plaque 
With the strength to stand and say gangsta rap was whack 
The fact is that when that brother rap or act 
Hold position, front of the pack 
Who am I? 

  
I be fully educated 
Not the one to play with 
And I find that some of y''all hate it 
But you wanna know baby 
Who am I? 
I be fully educated 
Not the one to play with 
And I find that some of y''all hate it 
But you wanna know baby 
Who am I? 

Baby if you really wanna know about me 
I''ll tell you who I am 
I''ll tell you I be not the one for games 
But if you''re right with me 
I know I''ll do the same 

I be fully educated 
Not the one to play with 
And I find that some of y''all hate it 
But you wanna know baby 
Who am I? 
I be fully educated 
Not the one to play with 
And I find that some of y''all hate it 
But you wanna know baby 
Who am I? 
(L-Y-T-E) 

  
Who am I? 
You dare to ask 
The same female that hailed from Brooklyn and wailed on that ass 
I''m your worst nightmare, you''re best wet dream 
Break the bank papi cause we''re coming for the cream 
And while I''m in the world ain''t none of y''all safe 
Hold face, sell a million and you still won''t equate 
So who am I? It ain''t hard to tell 
Like staying on track cause you thinking I fell 
See a lot know my face but a few know me well 
Just who I am is the one to make ya gel 
Who am I? The chick that keeps spittin'' 
Taking back all my snip that was bitten 
Rewritten dangerous laison 
With the shades on 
Making sure the track stays on 
Days on end I''ll be that one true friend 
That will always be around when the world falls down 
I''m honest to the bone 
No question, suggest 
You don''t wanna know 
I give the truth, nothing less than 
I''m sweet with a heart to fit 
Smart as a whip 
You feed me well but I''m still hard to get 
I''m like a calculus problem hard to solve 
Study me well if you wanna get involved 
And even after that I''m still unpredictable 
Now who am I? I''m unforgettable 

  
I be fully educated 
Not the one to play with 
And I find that some of y''all hate it 
But you wanna know baby 
Who am I? 
I be fully educated 
Not the one to play with 
And I find that some of y''all hate it 
But you wanna know baby 
Who am I? 
I be fully educated 
Not the one to play with 
And I find that some of y''all hate it 
But you wanna know baby 
Who am I? 
I be fully educated 
Not the one to play with 
And I find that some of y''all hate it 
But you wanna know baby 
Who am I?
