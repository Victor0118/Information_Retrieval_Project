 
Let's Conquer, Big Daddy, Kevin Miller, Grandma Miller and Grandma Elizabeth

 
To My Loves I gone, I gotta know
Where do we go from here, I gotta know

 
Dear God, I remember when times was hard
Gunshots echoed the block like passin' cars
I miss my cousin Lance look out for him
I love him,he died so young you musta had a place for him
My Uncle Kevin, the family miss him
He in Heaven, I ain't really understand 'till I turned seven
Every year that go by
I try to understand why (I understand why)
Everytime someone born, somebody gotta die 
It's sad, I hate to see my mama cry
It's okay, come here mom and wipe your eyes
It's hard ta focus, kids playin' in school thinkin' they soldiers
Teachers can't teach now they nervous
Sittin' there thinkin' ta myself what we do to deserve this
Seein' kids die for no purpose ( I don't know)
Sittun' there thinkin' ta myself what we do to deserve this
Seein' kids die for no purpose

 
(Take my pain away)
To my love ones gone, I gotta know
Where do we go from here, I gotta know
(Take my pain away)

 
The fast life is much too short, that's what we all thought
In and out of courts for assualts of all sorts
Seein' you go had me feelin' low
Just ta know a brotha was about to blow
But the world was killin' him slow
Your fans miss you wit a passion
And they wonder are you still alive and still laughin'
I still stress over your death
Caught four in to your chest
Lay your rest to the west
May your soul be blessed
And Lord knows how we miss you
Murder is a big issue
Can't stop the blood wit tissue
When the slugs hit you
All your family and friends shed tears
Cause for years 
We knew you would make it, it was clear
Toast to both coasts
We need to stand close
Cause it ain't no silence when God is right in front of your eyes
Awakin' the time to shine
In time you'll find
I roll a dutch
Cause the worlds to much, to take my pain away

 

 
I shed tears for da world.Death carries no age limit. 
To my love ones up there pray for me, 
Life is prevailant. Oh yeah Lance picture this boy. 
I'm rappin' and ballin' ya heard. 
R.I.P to my peeps. I miss y'all, I miss y'all.
