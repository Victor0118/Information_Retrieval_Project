      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Bad Religion - Dharma And The Bomb . Wasted days and cigarettes Cracked cement and palms Bodhidharma has gone fission With your vedic mom Yeah the Sergeant Major is dreamin' of genie And she's armed with a borrowed polka dot bikini Oh yeah, tomorrow's coming down like dharma and the bomb . Falling down Falling down Like dharma and the bomb Falling down Falling down Like dharma and the bomb . The shallows seem evangelical When you're slammed up against a wall And you're stoked to watch all creation go over the falls Yeah Kali is coming and you'd better believe it That girl's got the atom and the bhagavad ghita Oh yeah, samsara's coming down like dharma and the bomb . Falling down Falling down Like dharma and the bomb Falling down Falling down Like dharma and the bomb . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
