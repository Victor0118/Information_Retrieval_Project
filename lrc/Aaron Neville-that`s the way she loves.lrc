With her mind far away from mine She's mostly sincere most of the time Yeah That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves, that's the way she loves That's the way she loves That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves That's the way she loves With her strong desire to please Oppression to her, is like a disease Yeah That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves, that's the way she loves That's the way she loves That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves That's the way she loves Many times when she's alone She dreams and dreams and dreams Dreaming of a perfect love That never was, and would never be With her heart placed in her hand She will go to the end and back if she can for me That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves, that's the way she loves That's the way she loves That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves That's the way she loves That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves, that's the way she loves That's the way she loves That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves That's the way she loves That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves, that's the way she loves That's the way she loves That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves That's the way she loves
