Under the lover-sky
Gonna be with you
And no one`s gonna be around
If you think that you won`t fall
Well just wait until
`Til the sun goes down
Underneath the starlight, starlight
There`s a magical feeling so right
It will steal your heart tonight
You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know
That you, can`t fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you`ll surrender your heart
Don`t you know, don`t you know that you
Can`t fight the moonlight..No
You can`t fight it...
It`s gonna get to your heart
There`s no escaping love
Once a gentle breeze
Weaves a spell upon your heart
No matter what you think
It won`t be too long
`Til you`re in my arms
Underneath the starlight, starlight
We`ll be lost in the rhythm so right
Feel it steal your heart tonight
You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know
That you can`t fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you`ll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can`t fight the moonlight...No
You can`t fight it
No matter what you do
The night is gonna get to you
Don`t try, you`re never gonna win, oh
Underneath the starlight, starlight,
There`s a magical feeling, so right
It`ll steal your heart tonight
You can try to resist, try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know that you
Can`t fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you`ll surrender your heart,
But you know, but you know that you
Can`t fight the moonlight
No, you can`t fight it
You can try to resist, try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know that you
can`t fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you`ll surrender your heart,
But you know, but you know that you
Can`t fight the moonlight
No, you can`t fight it
It`s gonna get to your heart
