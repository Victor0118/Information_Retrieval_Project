 That shit is old, don't be screamin' get at me dawg
 Have you runnin' for ya life when I match ya boy
 I get to wavin' that semi, like its legal
 A lil nigga hurt his arm lettin' off that eagle
 You know me, black on black bentley, big ol' black nine
 I'll clap your monkey ass, get black on black crime
 Big ol' chrome rims, gleem you know why I shine
 C'mon man, you know how I shine
 I'm in the hood, in the drop, Teflon vinyl top
 Got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, why I don't hear no shots
 That fat nigga thought Lean Back was "In Da Club"
 My shit sold 11 mill, his shit was a dud
 Jada don't fuck with me if you wanna eat
 Cause I'll do your lil ass like Jay did Mobb Deep
 Yeah homie, in New York, niggas like your vocals
 But that s only in New York, dawg your ass is local

 Banks shit sells, Buck shit sells, Game shit sells
 I'm rich as hell, Shyne poppin' off his mouth from a cell
 He don't want it with me, he in PC
 I can have a nigga run up on him with a shank
 For just a few pennies out my piggy bank
 Yayo, bring the condoms, I'm in room 203
 Freak bitch look like Kim before the surgeory
 Its an emergency, a Michael Jackson see
 Looked at a picture and said she looks like me
 Kelis said her milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
 Then Nas went and tattooed the bitch on his arm
 I mean that way out in Cali, niggas know you cuz
 First thing they say about you, is you a sucker for love
 This is chess, not checkers, these are warning shots
 After your next move I'll give you what I got (Yeah!!)
 Clickity clank clickity clank
