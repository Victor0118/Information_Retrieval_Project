Living on the riverside taking it all in my stride
Living on the riverside, I'm taking life like a big long ride
You stay on your side and I'll stay on mine
You take what you want and I'll take the sunshine

Dit dit dit dit do ...
Ah-, ah-

I said the world don't owe me no living
I said the world don't owe me no living
I said the world don't owe me no living
I said the world don't owe me no living
