      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Martina McBride – Born to Give My Love to You . I don't know what brought us here Something in the stars said you and me I don't know where this feeling comes from Surely it was meant to be For I have know you even in my dreams My eyes are open, my heart can see . As sure as stars light the midnight sky As sure as children wonder why As sure as newborn babies cry I was born to give my love to you Born to give my love to you . Heaven must be holding on To all the love I'm feeling now Here we are this is a moment I believe it's our turn somehow Hearts together, hands across the night One forever, finally in sight . As sure as stars light the midnight sky As sure as children wonder why As sure as newborn babies cry I was born to give my love to you Born to give my love to you . I was born to give my love to you  (I was born to give my love to you) I was born to give my love to you I was born to give my love to you . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
