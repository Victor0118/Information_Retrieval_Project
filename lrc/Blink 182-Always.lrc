 I've been here before a few times 
 And I'm quite aware we're dying 
 And your hands they shake with goodbyes 
 And I'll take you back if you'd have me  
 So here I am, I'm trying 
 So here I am, are you ready? 
 
 Come on let me , hold you, touch you, feel you. 
 Always 
 Kiss you, taste you, all night.  
 Always 
 
 And I'll miss your laugh your smile 
 I'll admit I'm wrong if you'd tell me 
 I'm so sick of fights I hate them 
 Lets start this again for real 
 
 So here, I am, I'm trying 
 So here I am, are you ready? 
 So here I am, I'm trying 
 So here I am, are you ready? 
 
 Come on let me hold you, touch you ,feel you. 
 Always 
 Kiss you, taste you, all night . 
 Always 
 Come on let me hold you, touch you, feel you. 
 Always 
 Kiss you taste you, all night,  
 Always 
 
 I've been here before a few times 
 And I'm quite aware we're dying 
 
 Come on let me hold you touch you feel you 
 Always 
 Kiss you taste you all night  
 Always 
 Come on let me hold you touch you feel you 
 Always 
 Kiss you taste you all night  
 Always 
 Always 
 Always
