      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Lisa Loeb  - Matches . There's wood for the fire but there's no matches no matches been here for awhile but there's no matches no matches . Just fools on a wire balancing old and untried so we will fall into the night 'cause there's no matches no matches . Last night I closed my eyes see my life flashing, flashing why am I so surprised that it's not lasting, lasting . I can't make a sound 'cause I have burned to the ground ashes and dust falling down among the old matches, old matches . Please wash the ashes away you know I don't like to beg but give me a spark to cut the grey 'cause there's no matches . 'Cause there's no matches no more matches no matches . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
