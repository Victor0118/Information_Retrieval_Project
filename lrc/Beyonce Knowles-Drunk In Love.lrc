 演唱：Beyonce,Jay-Z
 
 I've been drinking, I've been drinking

 

 I get filthy when that liquor gets into me

 I've been thinking, I've been thinking

 

 Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?

 I want you, na na

 

 Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?

 I want you, na na

 

 Cigars on ice, cigars on ice

 

 Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill

 Flashing lights, flashing lights

 

 You got me faded, faded, faded

 Baby, I want you, na na

 

 Can't keep your eyes off my fatty

 Daddy, I want you, na na

 

 Drunk in love, I want you

 

 We walk up in the kitchen saying

 "How in hell did this shit happen?"

 Oh baby, drunk in love we be all night

 

 Last thing I remember is our

 Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club

 

 Drunk in love

 

 We be all night, love, love

 

 We be all night, love, love

 We be all night, and everything alright

 

 No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights

 Boy, I'm drinking, walking in my l'assemblage

 I'm grubbing on the rope, grubbing if you scared, call that ribbon

 Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right

 I'm on the Cognac, gangster wife

 Newer sheets, he'd swear that I like washed rags, he wet up

 Boy, I'm drinking, I'm sinking on the mic 'til my boy toys

 Then I fill the tub up halfway then riding with my surfboard

 Surfboard, surfboard

 

 Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood

 I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body Benz

 Serving all this, swerv, surfing all of this good, good

 

 We walk up in the kitchen saying

 "How in hell did this shit happen?"

 Oh baby, drunk in love we be all night

 

 Last thing I remember is our

 Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club

 

 Drunk in love

 

 We be all night, love, love

 

 We be all night, love, love

 Hold up

 That D'USSé is the shit if I do say so myself

 If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself

 Hold up, stumble all in the house tryna backup all that mouth

 That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far

 Talking 'bout you be repping that verb, wanna see all that shit I heard

 Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve

 Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol

 Slid the panties right to the side

 Ain't got the time to take draws off, on site

 Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike

 In '97 I bite, I'm Ike, Turner, turn up

 Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Annie Mae

 Said, "Eat the cake, Annie Mae!"

 I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights we gon' need G3

 

 4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight

 

 We sex again in the morning, your breasteses is my breakfast

 We going in, we be all night

 

 We be all night, love, love

 

 Never tired, never tired

 

 I been sippin, that's the only thing keeping me on fire, me on fire

 

 To me it's feeling like all of my entire life I've been drinking

 Boy, I'm Marilyn

 

 I want your body right here, daddy I want you, right now

 

 C-can't keep ya eyes off my fatty

 Daddy I want you

 

 We be all night, love, love

 

 We be all night, love, love
