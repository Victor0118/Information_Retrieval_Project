 Yeah but they need a beat that they can freak to
 Huh yaknahmean?
 
 Uhh, bounce, yeah
 Uhh.. bounce, yeah
 Uhh.. you heard it from hearsay
 Uhh.. you heard it from hearsay

 You wanna bang 'em bang 'em bang 'em 'til you can't no more
 Day-dreamin, bout slidin in that Bentley door
 Cuban chain tucked in so the back'll show
 Whip it out in front of chicks, they react to dough
 Fo' karats in each ear, lettin dude know
 That homes still flow like twenty-twos of snow
 Yankee over doo-rags, extra wristbands
 Pass the Heineken, you're not a Crist' fan
 Ice is the tightest, broads breakin they neck
 And catchin arthritis to bag a ghetto Midas
 Jeans saggin down (uh) with the Michael Vick jersey
 The white on whites from Uptown
 Wifebeater underneath
 If it's totally necessary, some gold teeth, it's on you
 Pull up to the club real slow, leanin back on the cell
 What the hell, these clowns is pointin at?

    (If you got the time.. then I've got the time) You clockin' G's
    You're monopoly, and you property
    (Tell homes over there to step off) You clockin' G's
    (If you got the time.. then I've got the time) You clockin' G's
    You're monopoly, and you property
    (Tell homes over there to step off) You clockin' G's

 Uhh, slide out slow (slowwwww)
 Argue on the phone (uh) glance at the chrome (yea)
 Hand on your waist just in case it's on
 Fully prepared to go to war 'til the break of dawn
 Slid a twenty to the bouncer, hold down the car
 Rollin up {?} to rush into the bar
 It's a simple recipe, I-C-E
 S-H-I-N-E equals free P
 Mad birds in the jump-off (uh) lookin thirsty
 Hot and broke, daddy have mercy
 She want Prada, the pearl of drawers
 The new Fendi mink so she can act stink
 The camouflage Pumas with the crystal stripes
 The Mz. Gatrak joints to keep her weave tight
 One clown tried to throw your vibe off all night
 Not knowin that you 20 deep, and you aight

 It's that, head-boppin, neck-jerkin
 Keep you on the block cold focused, straight workin
 Head-boppin, neck-jerkin
 Keep you on the block cold focused, straight workin
 Head-boppin, neck-jerkin
 Keep you on the block cold focused, straight workin
 Head-boppin, neck-jerkin
 Keep you on the block cold focused, straight workin
 
 Huh.. waffle house, three-thirty
 You ain't really hungry, you do it for the birdies
 (Fly pelican fly) And they do it for you
 Even though they always tell you what they not gon' do
 You know the game, you a patient killer
 Whisper sweet nothings, then switch gorilla
 She wanna ride in the 6, pick CD's
 Cause it's lookin so sick, with six TV's
 While you leanin back laughin, doin twenty-five
 Ridin real slow that's how gangstas ride
 You wanna bang her bang her bang her 'til you can't no more
 Dream over, you're closin the Bentley door, out
