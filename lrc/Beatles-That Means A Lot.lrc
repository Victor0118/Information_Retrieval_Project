That Means A Lot
 A friend says that your love
 won't mean a lot
 And you know that your love
 is all you've got

 that means a lot

 A friend says that a love
 is never true
 And you know that this
 don't apply to you

 Love can be deep inside,
 love can be suicide
 Can't you see you can't hide
 what you feel when it's real
