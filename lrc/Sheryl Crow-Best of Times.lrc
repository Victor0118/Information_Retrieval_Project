      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Best of Times - Sheryl Crow . I’ve got a class two Continental Made in 1965 But with a “save the planet” sticker That makes it kind of hard o drive . I got a big house full of pebbles And I’m a big fan of both kinds I never want to keep the doctor away I wanted to show my sweet young mind . It’s the best of times It’s the worst of times Might not change the world But I’ll change it in mine . Chanel my teens fears Our best days are behind Like mine Like mine . And my toys are made in China My guitar’s in Mexico My foams and food comes from Japan Give me a dog from Chicago . I need to take myself to Yellowstone Climb up to that blue ridge too Remind myself of what’s beautiful About the big muddy whatever . It’s the best of times It’s the worst of times Might not change the world But I’ll change it in mine . Chanel my teens fears Our best days are behind Like mine Like mine . When I woke up this morning I got down on my knees to pray ‘Cause my end time is done running out But my calendar’s full of days . It’s the best of times It’s the worst of times Might not change the world But I’ll change it in mine . Making music parts Our best days are behind Like mine Like mine Like mine Like mine Like mine . 歌词编辑：活在當下     QQ：6313827
