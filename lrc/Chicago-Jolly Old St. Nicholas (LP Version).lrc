     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Jolly Old St. Nicholas(LP Version) - Chicago Jolly old St. Nicholas Lean your ear this way!  Don't you tell a single soul What I'm going to say;  Christmas Eve is coming soon  Now, you dear old man,  Whisper what you'll bring to me  Tell me if you can.  When the clock is striking twelve,  When I'm fast asleep,  Down the chimney broad and black, With your pack you'll creep  All the stockings you will find Hanging in a row  Mine will be the shortest one, You'll be sure to know.  What's it gonna be, Santa Underneath the tree, Santa What's it gonna be, Santa Be this for me  Jolly old St. Nicholas Now you dear old man  Whisper what you'll bring to me Tell me if you can  What's it gonna be, Santa Underneath the tree, Santa What's it gonna be, Santa Be this for me  Jason wants a Fender bass Walt a saxophone  Lee, he needs a flugelhorn  Jimmy, a trombone  Robert wants a baby grand  Bill, a new B3  Tris, he wants a dolly, but  What are you gonna bring to me, Santa?  What's it gonna be, Santa Underneath the tree, Santa What's it gonna be, Santa Be this....  What's it gonna be, Santa Underneath the tree, Santa What's it gonna be, Santa Be this for me  How about a shiny electric guitar, Santa?  陈先生 QQ：1552195557
