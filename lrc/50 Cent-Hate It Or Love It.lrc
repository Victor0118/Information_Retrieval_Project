  The Game feat. 50 Cent
         Lyric by rummyjulia
         to my pretty boy~_*
 Yeah, let's take 'em back 
 Uh-huh.. 
 Comin up I was confused, my mommy kissin a girl 
 Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world 
 Daddy ain't around, probably out commitin felonies 
 My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check check out +My Melody+" 
 I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope 
 Four-four finger ring, one of them gold ropes 
 Lana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat 
 If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope 
 Tossed and turned in my sleep that night 
 Woke up the next mornin, niggaz had stole my bike 
 Different day, same shit, ain't nuttin good in the hood 
 I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could 
     Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top 
     And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop 
     (Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P.) 
   (And I ain't goin nowhere, so you can get to know me) 
 G-G-G-G-G-Unit, on the grill of my lowrider 
 Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires 
 I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song 
 and really do it, that's the true meanin of a ghostwriter 
 Ten G'sll take your daughter out her Air Forces 
 Believe you me homey, I know all about losses 
 I'm from Compton, where the wrong colors be cautious 
 One phone call'll have your body dumped in marshes 
 I stay strapped like car seats, been bangin 
 since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys 
 That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five 
 I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's 
 Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride 
 and if I gotta die, I'd rather a homicide 
 I ain't have 50 Cent when my grandmama died 
 Now I'm goin back to Cali with my Jacob on 
 See how time fly? 
 From the beginnin to the end, losers lose 
 When it's win this is real we ain't got to pretend 
 The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain 
 Enough of me nigga now listen to Game 
 Used to see five-oh, throw the crack by the bench 
 Now I'm fuckin with 5-0 it's all startin to make sense 
 My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent 
 And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz 
 Waitin on shop money to lamp, sittin in the Range 
 Thinkin how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes 
 when there's kids starvin 
 'Pac is gone and Brenda still throwin babies in the garbage 
 I wanna know "What's Goin' On" like I hear Marvin 
 No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins 
 Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted 
 I think what if Marie Bank had got that abortion? 
 I love you ma
