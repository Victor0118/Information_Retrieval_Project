Abba - Money, money, money

 I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay
 Ain't it sad
 And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me
 That's too bad
 In my dreams I have a plan
 If I got me a wealthy man
 I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball

 Money, money, money
 Must be funny in the rich man's world
 Money, money, money
 Always sunny in the rich man's world
 Aha-ahaaa, all the things I could do
 If I had a little money
 It's a rich man's world

 It's a rich man's world
 
 A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind
 Ain't it sad
 And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me
 That's too bad
 So I must leave, I'll have to go
 To Las Vegas or Monaco
 And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same

  Money, money, money
  Must be funny in the rich man's world
  Money, money, money
  Always sunny in the rich man's world
  Aha-ahaaa, all the things I could do
  If I had a little money
  It's a rich man's world

 It's a rich man's world
