     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Just A Little(Album Version) - Sugar Ray You met her, persuade her but still she's miles away  She crossed her fingers, won't look back at yesterday  Sometimes you feel like you can run back into her arms  You made her, persuade her, don't let her slip away  Don't let her slip away  Ooh, just a little more baby, can't you see? You're running away  Just a little more baby, stay with me You're running away, you're running away You're running away  Surrender, protect her, I gave myself away  She rolls her eyes at all the stupid things I say  Sometimes I feel I can't run back into her arms  I made her, forgave her but some things never change  Don't let her slip away Ooh, just a little more baby, can't you see? You're running away  Just a little more baby, stay with me You're running away, you're running away You're running away  And you know you got me running Got me thinking 'bout the other side  And you know you got me hoping Got me praying, need you by my side  Oh baby  Ooh, just a little more baby, can't you see? You're running away  Just a little more baby, stay with me You're running away, you're running away You're running away  陈先生 QQ：1552195557
