 And human behaviour
 Be ready to get confused
   There's definitely no logic
 To human behaviour
 But yet so irristible
  Yeah
   And there is no map
 They're terribly moody
 Of human behaviour
 Then all of a sudden turn happy
 But, oh, to get involved in the exchange
 Of human emotions is ever so satisfying
 And a compass
 Wouldn't help at all
           Human behaviour
    Human
