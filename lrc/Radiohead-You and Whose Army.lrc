Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy
Come on, come onYou and whose army?
You and your cronies
Come on, come on
Holy Roman empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us on
You can take us onYou and whose army?
You and your croniesYou forget so easily
We ride tonightGhost horses
