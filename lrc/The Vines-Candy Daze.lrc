 Candy daze are here to stay forever
 They light the way and keep us all together
 
 C'mon C'mon
 Singin' a song
 It won't be long
 For we are gone
 
 Candy daze are here to stay forever
 They light the way and keep us all together
 
 It'll be alright
 I don't know I say it might
 It'll seem alright
 She spit in my face
