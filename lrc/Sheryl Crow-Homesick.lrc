      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Homesick - Sheryl Crow . I’ve gotten used to being gone Silhouettes and unmade beds And more and more when I’m alone I think of you . I’m getting tired of going nowhere But it’s all I ever do But I can turn this thing around Guess I don’t want to . I turn the key, open up the door I sit my suitcase down on the hardwood floor And I call your name, and I climb the stairs Then I realize that you’re not there . And I get homesick I get homesick I get homesick For anywhere but home . I think I used to have the answers Oh but now I just don’t know Well that question still hangs on Why did I let you go? Why did I let you go? . I turn the key, open up the door I sit my suitcase down on the hardwood floor And I call your name, and I climb the stairs Then I realize that you’re not there . And I get homesick I get homesick I get homesick For anywhere but home . I keep wishing I’ll lose my mind time and time again There’s a picture of it in my head Of me and you up there . I get homesick I get homesick I get homesick For anywhere but home Anywhere but home . I get homesick I get homesick (Oh yes I do) I get homesick For anywhere but… Anywhere but home Oh but anywhere but home ‘Cause I miss you . 歌词编辑：活在當下     QQ：6313827
