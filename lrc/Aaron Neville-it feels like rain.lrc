Down here the river meets the sea In the sticky heat I feel you open up to me Love comes out of no where, baby, oh, just like a hurricane And it feels like rain And it feels like rain Lying underneath the stars right next to you And I'm wondering who you are, and how do you do, how do you do baby Oh, the clouds roll in across the moon, and the wind howls out your name And it feels like rain And it feels like rain We never gonna make that bridge tonight, baby Set across the Poncetrain And it feels like rain And it feels like rain Batten down the hatches, baby Leave your heart out on your sleeve Looks like we're in for stormy, stormy, stormy weather That ain't no cause to leave Just like Let it wash away the pain And it feels like rain And it feels like rain Baby can you feel it, can you feel it It feels like rain Baby can you feel it, can you feel it Feels like rain Let your love, let your love come down Oh, down on me
