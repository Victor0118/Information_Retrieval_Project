 the way we were
 Memories light the corners of my mind
 Misty water color memories
 Of the way we were
 Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
 Smiles we gave to one another
 Fore the way we were
 *Can't it be that it was all so simple then
 Or has time rewritten every line
 And if we had the chance to do it all again
 Tell me would we, could we
 Memories maybe beautiful and yet
 What's too painful to remember
 We simply choose to forget
 So it's the laughter, we will remember
 Whenever we remember the way we were
 Remember, the way we were
