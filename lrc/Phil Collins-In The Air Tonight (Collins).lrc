          Oh Lord
      I've been waiting for this moment, 
      all my life, 
     I Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, 
     Oh Lord, Oh Lord
 Well, if you told me you were drowning
 I would not lend a hand
 I've seen your face before my friend
 But I don't know if you know who I am
 Well, I was there and I saw what you did
 I saw it with my own two eyes
 So you can wipe off the grin, 
 I know where you've been
 It's all been a pack of lies
  And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, 
 I've been waiting for this moment 
 for all my life, 
 I can feel it in the air tonight, 
 And I've been waiting for this moment 
 Well I remember, 
 I remember don't worry
 How could I ever forget, it's the first time, 
 the last time we ever met
 But I know the reason why you keep your silence up, 
 no you don't fool me
 The hurt doesn't show; 
 but the pain still grows
 It's no stranger to you or me
 Oh Lord...
