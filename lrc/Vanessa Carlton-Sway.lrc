 My heart, your hands, gentle my friend
 Break me neatly, numb me sweetly
   Say you would, say you could
   Say you'd come and stop the rain
   Say you'd try and hold me tight
   And you just give me away
   Make me high on lullabies
   A melody for me to sway
   Say you would, say you could
   And you don't do anything

 Come down heavy, try and steady
 Precious ladies, love you, love me...
 
 Hold my head up to the lies that you feed me
 I'll fall under the spell you cast
 As you let me down
 
 Say you would, say you could
 Say you'd come and stop the rain
 Say you'd try and hold me tight
 And you just give me away
 Make me high on lullabies
 A melody for me to sway
 Make me high on lullabies
 A melody for me to sway
 
 Say you'd come and stop the rain...
