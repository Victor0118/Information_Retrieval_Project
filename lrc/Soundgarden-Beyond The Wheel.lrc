 Far beyond the road
 Between your house and home
 There is a churning storm
 Of hailing burning bones
 Tiny baby cries
 Little, tiny pawn
 In the profit gain
 Tiny baby grows
 Mother, who's your man
 Is he doing what he can
 To make a proper home, home
 By overturning other stones, stones
 Father, mighty man
 Loves his little boys, boys
 Shows them how to kill
 To save his precious stones, stones
  Far beyond the wheel
  It steers your life around
  We're driving flesh and blood
 Deep into the ground, ground
 Deep into the ground, ground
