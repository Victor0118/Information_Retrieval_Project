      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Sometimes it'll all roll out and sometimes you have to make it happen I've seen it fall into my lap and I've seen it walk away . So there you are feeling like a fallen star can't read the headlines now, they're faded . Tied to your phone rock under paper, like a sitting stone you've never seemed so sad and jaded . Swept away you wanted to get swept away No luck so far who knew it could be so hard waiting for the lights to change . You want to know if it's green, if it's gonna go you're looking for someone to blame . Sometimes it'll all roll out and sometimes you have to make it happen I've seen it fall into my lap and I've seen it walk away . Swept away you wanted to get swept away 'cause it's so dry, dry here at home things could change, oh baby only things could change but you won't try anymore . Sometimes it'll all roll out and sometimes you have to make it happen I've seen it fall into my lap and I've seen it walk away . One day you'll learn the path is long, the road is worn you have to try, and try, and try and try and try and try again . Sometimes it'll all roll out sometimes you have to make it happen I've seen it fall into my lap and I've seen it walk away . Sometimes it'll all roll out and sometimes it even makes you happy I've seen it fall into my lap don't let it walk away . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
