 If only I could get through this
 I get through this
 
 I gotta get through this
 I gotta get through this
 I gotta make it, make it, make it through
 I'm gotta get through this
 I gotta get through this
 I gotta take my, take my mind off you
  Give me just a second and I'll be all right
  Surely one more moment couldn't break my heart
  Give me 'til tomorrow then I'll be okay
  Just another day and then I'll hold you tight
  
  When your love is falling like the rain
  I close my eyes and it falls again
  When will I get the chance to say I love you
  I pretend that you're already mine
  Then my heart ain't breaking every time
  I look into your eyes
  If only I could get through this
  If only I could get through this
  If only I could get through this
  God, gotta help me get through this
 
 I gotta get through this
 I gotta get through this
 I gotta make it, make it, make it through
 Said I'm gotta get through this
 I gotta get through this
 I gotta take my, take my mind off you
 If only I could get through this
 God, gotta help me get through this
 If only I could get through this
 God, gotta help me get through this
 If only I could get through this...
