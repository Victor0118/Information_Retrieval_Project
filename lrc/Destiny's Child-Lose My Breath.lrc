 Hit me
            Can you keep up? 
            Babyboy, make me lose my breath 
            bring the noise, make me lose my breath 
      hit me hard, make me lose my hhhh hhhh 
 hit me hard, make me lose my breath 
    Oohh... 
 I put it right there, made it easy for you to get to 
 now you wanna act like you don't know what to do 
 after I done done everything that you asked me 
 grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you 
 moved so fast, baby now i can't find you 
 I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you 
 all that talk but it seems like you can't come through 
 all them lines like you could satisfy me 
 now I see where believing you got me 
 gave you the wheel but you can't drive me 
     hit me hard, make me lose my breath
 Two things i don't like when i'm trynna get my groove 
 is a partner that meets me only halfway, and just can't prove 
 Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim 
 need a lifegaurd and I need protection 
 to put it on me deep in the right direction 
 You understand the facts that I'm trynna get to you 
 You movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue 
 Didn't momma teach you to give affection 
 learn the difference from a man and an adolescent 
 It ain't you boo, so get ta steppin' 
  If you can't make me say oohh 
 Like the beat of this drum 
 Why you ask for some 
 You ain't really want none 
 Like the beat of this groove 
 You don't have no business in this 
 Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed 
 <END>
