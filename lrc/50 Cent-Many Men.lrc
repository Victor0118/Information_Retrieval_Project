   
 Man we gotta go get something to eat man 
 I'm hungry as a motherfucker 

   
 Ay yo man, damn what's taking homie so long son? 

   
 50, calm down, here he come 

 9 shots


  
 Many men, wish death upon me 
 Blood in my eye dawg and I can't see 
 I'm trying to be what I'm destined to be 
 And niggaz trying to take my life away 
 I put a hole in nigga for fucking with me 
 My back on the wall, now you gon' see 
 Better watch how you talk, when you talk about me 
 Cause I'll come and take your life away 

 Many men, many, many, many, many men 
 Wish death 'pon me 
 Lord I don't cry no more 
 Don't look to the sky no more 
 Have mercy on me 

  
 Now these pussy niggaz putting money on my head 
 Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead 
 I'm the diamond in the dirt, that ain't been found 
 I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned 
 When I rhyme, something special happen every time 
 I'm the greatest, something like Ali in his prime 
 I walk the block with the bundles 
 I've been knocked on the humble 
 Swing the ox when I rumble 
 Show your ass what my gun do 
 Got a temper nigga, go'head, lose your head 
 Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs 
 I walk around gun on waist, chip on my shoulder 
 Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over 

  
   Many men, many, many, many, many men 
   Wish death 'pon me 
   Lord I don't cry no more 
   Don't look to the sky no more 
   Have mercy on me 
   Have mercy on my soul 
   Somewhere my heart turned cold 
   Have mercy on many men 
   Many, many, many, many men 
   Wish death upon me 

  
 Some days wouldn't be special, if it wasn't for rain 
 Joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain 
 Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard 
 It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred 
 This if for my niggaz on the block, twisting trees and cigars 
 For the niggaz on lock, doing life behind bars 
 I don't see only god can judge me, 'cause I see things clear 
 Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years 
 I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don 
 Like Malcolm by any means, with my gun in my palm 
 Slim switched sides on me, let niggaz ride on me 
 I thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie? 

  

  
 Every night I talk to god, but he don't say nothing back 
 I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat 
 In my nightmares, niggaz keep pulling techs on me 
 Psych says some bitch dumb, put a hex on me 
 The feds didn't know much, when Pac got shot 
 I got a kite from the pens that told me, Tuck got knocked 
 I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time 
 Are you illiterate nigga? You can't read between the lines 
 In the bible it says, what goes around, comes around 
 Almost shot me, three weeks later he got shot down 
 Now it's clear that I'm here, for a real reason 
 'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fucking breathing
