 Listen, hear, he is inside
 One who lives while others lie
 I close my eyes and walk a thousand years
 A thousand years that aren't mine
 It seems he's near me as I walk
 One who loved what love denied
 He lives these years that I walk blind
 All these years cannot be mine
  Tomorrow begat tomorrow
   Begat tomorrow
 A thousand doors a thousand lies
 Rooms a thousand years wide
 He walks in the cold sun and wind
 All these years will not begin
 Begat tomorrow
