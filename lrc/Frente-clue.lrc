 frente  shape  clue   wooh do you have a clue? wooooh   wooh you dont have a clue wooooh  ive seen you talking with your friends  friends  clever young jokes in a world that never ends  ends  all the stars in the sky  just crossed your eyes  all the blood to your brain  is in vain  is in vain  walking up the steps with the lies behind your lips wooh  all your stupid friends love you for your mind wooh  ive seen you,  perfectly designed  dont make me smile,   dont make me smile  all you thoughts are perfectly unkind  dont make me smile  all the stars in the sky  just crossed your eyes  all the blood to your brain  is in vain  is in vain  wooh  aha  dont make me smile,  dont make me smile  all the stars in the sky  just crossed your eyes  all the blood to your brain  is in vain  is in vain
