Corcovado (Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars) 
Music by Antonio Carlos Jobim   
with lyrics by Gene Lees and Buddy Kaye  

Quiet nights 'n quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar  
Floating on the silence that surrounds us  
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams  
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together  
   
We will live eternally in this mood of reverie  
Away . . . from all the earthly cares around us  
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it  
And all at once the happiness I knew,   
Became these quiet nights of loving you!  
   
< instrumental break >  
   
We will live eternally in this mood of reverie  
Away . . . from all the earthly cares around us  
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it  
And all at once the happiness I knew,   
Became these quiet nights of loving you!  
   
Hmmm . . .
