      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Lisa Loeb  - The Worst . What if we could pass down heart break give the gift of making mistakes would I train my heart and not be so dramatic . I've been breaking my heart for the past ten years and it looks good and it feels good too . What if we could train our muscles and only use the ones that help us what if I could find the answers for you what if we could only smile and sadness didn't seem to pile up and what if you and I were meant to be together . I've been breaking my heart for the past ten years and it looks good and it feels good too I've been breaking my heart for the past ten years and it looks good and it feels good . Don't worry the worst is there to comfort you don't worry the worst is there to comfort you . What if I just upped and called you told you that I was thinking of you what if you were too busy would you take the time . I've been breaking my heart for the past ten years and it looks good and it feels good too I've been breaking my heart for the past ten years and it looks good and it feels good . Don't worry the worst is there to comfort you don't worry the worst is there to comfort you don't worry the worst is always there to comfort you now don't worry the worst is always there to comfort you . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
