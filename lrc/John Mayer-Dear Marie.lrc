     Dear Marie - John Mayer  Lrc By 潇风寒月 QQ:395254794  Dear Marie, tell me what it was I used to be  Dear Marie, tell me what it was I used to be  And if you’re further up the road can you show me what I still can’t see.  Remember me, I’m the boy you used to love when we were fifteen  Remember me, I’m the boy you used to love when we were fifteen  Now I wonder what you think when you see me on the magazine.  From time to time, I go looking for your photograph online  From time to time, I go looking for your photograph online  Some county judge in Ohio is all I ever find.  Dear Marie, tell me do you still believe in me  Dear Marie, tell me do you still believe in me  Yeah I’ve got my dream but you’ve got family  Yeah I’ve got my dream but you’ve got family  Yeah I’ve got my dream but I guess it got away from me  歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com
