Kel Spencer] 
(Uuhhh) 
Can you feel it baby? 
(Take me away) 
Flow crazy 
Make em'' say 
(Uuhhh) 
Make It hot, uh 
(Take me away) 
Flow crazy 
Make em'' say 
Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah) 
Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah) 

  
Been to the mountain top 
Down to the valley 
Philedelph to Cali 
Y''all feel me like Harry felt Sally 
Clothes exotic, flows erotic 
No jewels that''s for them fools who ain''t got it 
Rap to my own sitcom 
Now I just sit calm 
Watching y''all respond to my July 4th bomb (boom!) 
Yeah I''m a nice kid 
But here''s some advice kid 
Don''t get me hyped 
I''ll set it off like my wife did 
Playing down a path like Sajak 
Wheel of a Fortune away 
Price ain''t right I don''t play 
Find yourself in Jeopardy 
The first clue 
What is Will Smith? 
Hot to death not you 
I''m like a Porsche, you a pinto 
You like a tiny figurine, I''m monumental 
You''re like a small get together 
On your neighbor''s back porch 
You know just a couple of y''all 
I''m a million man march 
Attack of the man in black 
Like Jordan playing on a train 
Yo my game on track 
Mad ice for my wife 
No care for what it costed 
Had to ease up though 
Her wrist got frost bit 
My style, flava, delivery, my diction 
Gettin'' medieval like dude in Pulp Fiction 
You want some bring it 
Come one, come all, come in 
Watch me take they heart away like Penny 
I could take 12 rappers and put em'' in line 
Then 12 emcees that think they can rhyme 
Then 12 more brothers that still ain''t signed 
Then don''t do nothing just watch ''em decline 
Gangsta hardcore, menace to society 
Raps all the same 
My pen spits variety 
Eclecticism is a virtue 
It may not be a word 
But it''s definitely a virtue 
Rappers approaching me all across America 
Believe me you don''t wanna battle like Erykah 
I was in the game before publishing was an issue 
You''re platinum now but next year I''m gonna miss you 
Mad rappers like bad actors should have no parts 
Wanna be mad check the charts any of them 
Oh you don''t see my name 
You don''t see my spot 
Here''s a hint 
Look closer to the top 

  
(Uuhhh) 
Can you feel it baby? 
(Take me away) 
Flow crazy 
Make em'' say 
(Uuhhh) 
Make It hot, uh 
(Take me away) 
Flow crazy 
Make em'' say 
Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah) 
Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah) 

  
Uh, love and loyalty yo 
Yo the flow spray, Vito say 
I''m tryin'' to live 
And if I catch you out of bounds 
It''s cheap shots to the ribs 
Love and loyalty dawg 
Do it how Pac and Big did it 
It''s the Wild Wild East 
And me keepin'' me jig with it 
Play no games 
Thirst to heat the rhyme 
Motivation cause procrastination is the thief of time 
Holding a torch 
I was programmed to scorch 
Can''t run with the big dawgs? 
Then stay on the porch 
These cats is craftmatic 
Hand on the steering wheel 
Rocks from the road dodging oncoming traffic 
Man-handle rappers, dismantle rappers 
Y''all lukewarm slash sweet-scented candle rappers 
Any team posing a threat we defeat those 
The wealthy man is the man that knows how to keep dough 
As long as y''all play foul I''mma keep hittin'' free throws 
Crush Spanish mamis calling me Kellito 
Remember Lego blocks? 
All about the paper now 
I use writers block to build sky scraper style 
Catch rappers using the same flows everyday cause they lame 
True players gotta change their uniform after the game 
Y''all seen the flow 
Like y''all never seen before 
Don''t stop for the door 
Why do you think green mean gold? 
Baby learn life''s lessons 
Scratch regression 
Kel Spence the truth, the answer to all questions 
Come on (Uuhhh) 

  
Damn Kel, you kind of good
