 When there's no more forever
 Yeah, that's when I'll stop loving you (echos)
 Justin:
 That's when I'll stop loving you
 I'm sure you've heard these words before
 And I know it's hard for you to trust them once more
 You're afraid it all might end
 And a broken heart is scared of breaking again
 But you've gotta believe me 
 I'll never leave you
 You'll never cry long as I am there
 And I will always be there
 You will never be without love
 When winter comes in summer
 When there's no more forever
 When lies become the truth
 Oh you know then baby,
 That's when I'll stop lovin'
 That's when I'll stop loving you

 Light of love will be found in these eyes of mine (these eyes of mine)
 And I will shine that light for you
 You're the only one, I'll ever give this heart to
 What I'm trying to say is, nothing will change this (ahh..)
 There'll be no time you won't find me there (find me there)
 Cause I will always be there
 You will always have all my love
 When winter comes in summer
