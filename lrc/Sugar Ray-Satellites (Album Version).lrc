     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Satellites(Album Version) - Sugar Ray Easy I'm gonna fade away I'm gonna find my way around  Knee deep I get no where from sleep I'm running out of sheep to count  Not right I sit alone at night And on the bed I write it out  No time for giving up that line Or making up your mind You've got a right to pine about I'm feeling you tonight In the dream I think I'm falling  Bouncing off, of the satellite In the dream I think I'm flying  I feel you, I feel you Reach out and touch me, will you? I'm feeling you tonight  No saving for a rainy day When all of what they say you're out  No fame but all the rights the same They're gonna know my name in town  No reason for another season For some other teasing moans  No favor to the one that gave her Made a morning haven Inspired to save us all I'm feeling you tonight In the dream I think I'm falling Bouncing off, of the satellite In the dream I think I'm flying  I feel you, I feel you Reach out and touch me, will you? I'm feeling you tonight  Ooh yeah  I can see you touch the sun  Make a wish and don't tell anyone Ooh yeah  Then my eyes start focusing Then my eyes start focusing  Then my eyes start focusing  I can feel you In the dream I think I'm falling I can see you  In the dream I think I'm flying I feel you, I feel you Reach out and touch me, will you? I'm feeling you tonight  Reach out to me I could feel you  Reach out to me I could feel you  Reach out to me  I could feel you I'm feeling you tonight  In the dream I think I'm falling  In the dream I think I'm falling  In the dream I think I'm falling  In the dream I think I'm falling  陈先生 QQ：1552195557
