 by usher
 
 Hello everybody, huh
 Welcome today to the wonderful world of...you, he-heh
 Now check it, you have two options
 You can eat it or throw it away, heh
 
 See its a shame when you're working on doing well
 People hate you yeah
 Buying nothing that's not the best for yourself
 Then they really hate you yeah
 You gotta live for you and no one else
 Don't let 'em make you feel
 Like you're not being real
 Just live how you wanna live
 You gotta do for you
 
 (Dig that)
 If you work hard then play hard
 (Dig that)
 And do what you wanna do
 (Dig that)
 Just pop ya collar
 Don't let what people say bother you
 (Dig that)
 You perpetrators I got something to say
 (Dig that)
 You can eat it or throw it away
 (Picture that)
 You're just mad cause you're following in my trap
 But can you dig that?
 
  Hey ladies Hey fellas
 You know you're doing good cause they jealous
 (Pop, pop)
 And when they hate cause you're a go-getter
 (Pop, pop)
 Pop ya colla, don't let 'em sweat you
 (Pop)
  Hey ladies Hey fellas
 You know you're doing good cause they jealous
 (Pop, pop)
 And when they hate cause you're a go-getter
 (Pop, pop)
 Pop ya colla, don't let 'em sweat you
 (Pop)
 You can see me every week
 Hanging out with a different girl sitting next to me
 Cause I'm not up to settle down right now
 I gotta be free
 Some of y'all fellas might be jealous
 But y'all know that don't phase me
 I just pop my collar, tip my hat
 Turn my back on the ones that hated me
 
 (Dig that)
 Never going home alone
 (Dig that)
 If she follows then you know it's on
 (Dig that)
 She gets the pager not the cellular phone
 (Never that)
 I let her know I won't be around for long
 (Dig that)
 To all you haters I got something to say
 (What's that?)
 You can eat it or throw it away
 (Picture that)
 Stop hating, wishing, waiting
 Anticipating for my year to fade, oh yea
  Hey ladies Hey fellas
 You know you're doing good cause they jealous
 (Pop, pop)
 And when they hate cause you're a go-getter
 (Pop, pop)
 Pop ya colla, don't let 'em sweat you
 (Pop)
 I break my neck for the things I get
 So much sweat just so I can get that check
 And I'm not gonna let nobody bring me down
 Nobody's gonna steal my crown
 Because I eat good, I live good
 1I rock good, my life's good
 If you got a lot and you're working for it
 Pop ya collar don't be afraid to show it
  Hey ladies Hey fellas
 You know you're doing good cause they jealous
 (Pop, pop)
 And when they hate cause you're a go-getter
 (Pop, pop)
 Pop ya colla, don't let 'em sweat you
 (Pop)
