      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Shotgun - Sheryl Crow . You’d beg if I was under your hood But it ain’t doing us any good Rolling through town and going too slow What we need is an open road . 400 horses need a little room to run Well if you ain’t gonna do it let me show you how it’s done . Drive it like it’s stolen, park like it’s rented What’s the point of money if you ain’t gonna spend it? There’s a reason roads go past the city limits Do you wanna drive? Come on, you can ride shotgun Shotgun . Traffic jam as I’m sitting by, old man holding that same old sign Tell me that the end is near but they’ve been saying that 100 years But what if he’s right, baby? Maybe this time it’s true And we got nothing to lose . Drive it like it’s stolen, park like it’s rented What’s the point of money if you ain’t gonna spend it? There’s a reason roads go past the city limits Do you wanna drive? Then baby you can ride shotgun Shotgun . We gotta drive it like it’s stolen, park like it’s rented What good is your money if you ain’t gonna spend it? There’s a reason roads go past the city limits If you ain’t gonna drive then baby come on, ride shotgun . Drive it like it’s stolen, park like it’s rented (Shotgun) What’s the point of money if you ain’t gonna spend it? There’s a reason roads go past the city limits If you ain’t gonna drive then baby you can ride shotgun Shotgun . Shotgun . 歌词编辑：活在當下     QQ：6313827
