 Sugar Ray - She's Different    She was a crazy girl  She's from a different world and  I don't care  She cashed her check at 2  Her rent was overdue 'cause he's not there    Sing for me, sing for me  Show me the way  Sing for me, sing for me  'Cause you're goin' away    And if you're goin' away  I just don't know what to say  You're time was wasted  All you had to do was stay  Hey Mr. Officer  Please let me talk to her take her home  Sometimes it's hard to see  Impossibilities unknown    Sing for me, sing for me  Show me the way  Sing for me, sing for me  'Cause you're goin' away    'Cause if you're goin' away  I just don't know what to say  You're time was wasted  All you had to do was stay    Tear drops,tear fall from up the sky  (she's going away)  Tear drops,tear fall  (there's nothing to say) from up the sky  She's from a different world  (she's going away) from up the sky  She's not that kind of girl  She's leaving today  Sing for me,sing for me  Show me the way (show me the way)  Sing for me,sing for me  'Cause you're going away (going away)  And if you're going away  I just don't know what to say  Please show me the way (show me the way)  Sing for me,sing for me  'Cause you're going away (going away)      END
