 Whats The Story Morning Glory
 Champagne Supernova
 How many special people change?
 How many lives are living strange?
 Where were you while we were getting high?
 Slowly walking down the hall
 Faster than a cannonball
 Where were you while we were getting high?
 Someday you will find me
 Caught beneath the landslide
 In a champagne supernova in the sky
 Someday you will find me
 Caught beneath the landslide
 In a champagne supernova
 A champagne supernova in the sky
 Wake up the dawn and ask her why
 I dream a dream she never dies
 Wipe that tear away now from your eye
 Slowly walking down the hall
 Faster than a cannonball
 Where were you while we were getting high?
 Someday you will find me
 Caught beneath the landslide
 In a champagne supernova in the sky
 Someday you will find me
 Caught beneath the landslide
 In a champagne supernova
 A champagne supernova
 'Cuz we don't believe
 That they're gonna get away from the summer
 But you and I will never die
 The world's still spinning around we don't know why
 Why-why-why-why-i-i
