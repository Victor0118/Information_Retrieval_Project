      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Lisa Loeb - Walls . I can't tell you how I feel but listen in to the radio playing my heart sing the words I can't say to you the way I've always wanted to .  I'm scared to tell you how I feel I build it up and it's gonna break me I don't want to say what's in my head I'd tell the truth if I knew you would take me  . Oh my walls, won't you come down don't keep me here locked up forever oh my walls, won't you come down how will we be together? . I can't tell you how I feel but listen in to the radio playing my heart they sing the words that I can't say you can turn it up when it feels like I'm far away . Oh my walls, won't you come down don't keep me locked up forever oh my walls, won't you come down how will we be together? . I can't make another mistake I know it's right now or never oh my walls, if you won't come down we'll never be together . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
