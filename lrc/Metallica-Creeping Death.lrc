 Heed，To his every word, live in fear
 Faith，Of the unknown one, the deliverer
 Wait，Something must be done, four hundred years
 
 So let it be written
 So let it be done
 Im sent here by the chosen one
 So let it be written
 So let it be done
 To kill the first born pharaoh son
 Im creeping death
 
 Now，Let my people go, land of goshen
 Go，I will be with thee, bush of fire
 Blood，Running red and strong, down the Nile
 Plague，Darkness three days long, hail to fire
 
 So let it be written
 So let it be done
 Im sent here by the chosen one
 So let it be written
 So let it be done
 To kill the first born pharaoh son
 Im creeping death
 
 Die by my hand
 I creep across the land
 Killing first born man
 Die by my hand
 I creep across the land
 Killing first born man
 
 Rule the midnight air the destroyer
 Born，I shall soon be there, deadly mass
 Creep the steps and flood final darkness
 Blood，Lambs blood painted door, I shall pass
 
 So let it be written
 So let it be done
 Im sent here by the chosen one
 So let it be written
 So let it be done
 To kill the first born pharaoh son
 Im creeping death
