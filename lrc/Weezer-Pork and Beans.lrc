 www.lrcgc.com  活在当下 制作
 
 They say I need some Rogaine to put in my hair
 Work it out at the gym to fit my underwear
 Oakley makes the shades that transform a tool
 You’d hate for the kids to think that you lost your cool
 
 I’mma do the things that I wanna do
 I ain’t got a thing to prove to you
 I’ll eat my candy with the pork and beans
 Excuse my manners if I make a scene
 I ain’t gonna wear the clothes that you like
 I’m finally dandy with the me inside
 One look in the mirror and I’m tickled pink
 I don’t give a hoot about what you think
 
 Everyone likes to dance to a happy song (Hey, hey)
 With a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along (Hey, hey)
 Timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the charts
 Maybe if I work with him I can perfect the art
 
 I’mma do the things that I wanna do
 I ain’t got a thing to prove to you
 I’ll eat my candy with the pork and beans
 Excuse my manners if I make a scene
 I ain’t gonna wear the clothes that you like
 I’m finally dandy with the me inside
 One look in the mirror and I’m tickled pink
 I don’t give a hoot about what you think
 
 No I don’t care,
 I don’t care....
 
 I’mma do the things that I wanna do
 I ain’t got a thing to prove to you
 I’ll eat my candy with the pork and beans
 Excuse my manners if I make a scene
 I ain’t gonna wear the clothes that you like
 I’m finally dandy with the me inside
 One look in the mirror and I’m tickled pink
 I don’t give a hoot about what you think
