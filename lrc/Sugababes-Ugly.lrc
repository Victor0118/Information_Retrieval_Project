 Taller In More Ways
 by：胖头坨

 When I was 7
 They said I was strange
 I noticed that my eyes and hair weren't the same
 I asked my parents if I was OK
 They said you're more beautiful
 And that's the way they show that they wish
 They had your smile
 So my confidence was up for a while
 I got real comfortable with my own style
 I knew that they were only jealous cos

 People are all the same
 And we only get judged by what we do
 Personality reflects name
 And if I'm ugly then
 So are you
 So are you

 There was a time when I felt like I cared
 That I was shorter than everyone there
 People made me feel like life was unfair
 And I did things that made me ashamed
 Cos I didn't know my body would change
 I grew taller than them in more ways
 But there will always be the one who will say
 Something bad to make them feel great

 People are all the same
 And we only get judged by what we do
 Personality reflects name
 And if I'm ugly then
 So are you
 So are you

 People are all the same
 And we only get judged by what we do
 Personality reflects name
 And if I'm ugly then
 So are you
 So are you

 Everybody talks bad about somebody
 And never realises how it affects somebody
 And you bet it won't be forgotten
 Envy is the only thing it could be

 Cos people are all the same
 (The same, the same)
 And we only get judged by what we do
 (What we do, yeah, yeah)
 Personality reflects name
 And if I'm ugly then
 (Yeah, you)
 So are you
 So are you
 
 People are all the same
(Oh, oh, oh)
 And we only get judged by what we do
(What we do, yeah)
 Personality reflects name
 And if I'm ugly then
 (Yeah, so are you)
 So are you
 So are you
