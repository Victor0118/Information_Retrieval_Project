      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Kill The Lights - Matt Nathanson . My head's a stereo I can't turn off. You said I should learn to sing along. In your bedroom out on Taraval,  We were haunted by everything we wanted. . Kill the lights, I'm afraid of nothing. The church of your curves, The ghost inside us, The last temptation. . The night is young, but we are younger. Time is on our side. Kill the lights. . I found religion at the record store. I found heaven on your kitchen floor. You be stunning, baby, I'll be stunned. Keep glowing, I'll follow your explosions . Kill the lights, I'm afraid of nothing. The church of your curves, The ghost inside us, The last temptation. . The night is young, but we are younger. Time is on our side. Kill the lights. . Of all the things I left undone, I don't miss a single one. When everything felt good I'd fall apart. . All the things I couldn't see, Standing right in front of me. Your body pushed against me In the dark. . Kill the lights, I'm afraid of nothing. The church of your curves, The ghost inside us, The last temptation. . The night is young, but we are younger. Time is on our side. Kill the lights.  Kill the lights. . 歌词编辑：活在當下     QQ：6313827
