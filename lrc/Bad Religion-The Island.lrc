      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Bad Religion - The Island  There's a world outside but I can't really make it There's a life to lead but I can't exactly fake it Yet the mood feels right But my island is sinking out of sight  I made jetties so they'd catch all the sediment Removed the rocks and every impediment But the tide's rising high to wash away my island in the night  The sheltering sky was to be my everlasting lullaby They said that islands were solid as bedrock Standing firm forevermore But over time even basement wastes away to the unrelenting shore  There's a lonely seed waiting to be planted I've instructions but desire is wholly absent I'm just a petrel in the storm My island can't protect me anymore  歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
