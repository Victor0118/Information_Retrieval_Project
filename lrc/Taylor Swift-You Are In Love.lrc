 One look, dark room, meant just for you
 Time moved too fast, you played it back
 Buttons on a coat, light-hearted joke
 No proof, not much, but you saw enough
 Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight
 The light reflects the chain on your neck
 He says look up and your shoulders brush
 No proof, one touch, you felt enough
 You can hear it in the silence, silence
 You can feel it on the way home, way home
 You can see it with the lights out, lights out
 You are in love, true love
 You are in love
 Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday
 You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
 And for once you let go of your fears and your ghosts
 One step, not much, but it said enough
 You kissed on sidewalks, you fight and you talk
 One night he wakes, strange look on his face
 Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
 And you knew what it was, he is in love
 You can hear it in the silence, silence
 You can feel it on the way home, way home
 You can see it with the lights out, lights out
 You are in love, true love
 So it goes
 You two are dancing in a snow ball, go round and round
 And he keeps the picture of you in his office town downtown
 You understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
 And why I've spent my whole life try to put it in words
 Cause you can hear in the silence
 You can feel it on the way home
 You can see it with the lights out
 You are in love, true love
 You're in love
 You can hear it in the silence, silence
 You can feel it on the way home, way home
 You can see it with the lights out, lights out
 You are in love, true love
