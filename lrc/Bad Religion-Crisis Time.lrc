      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Bad Religion - Crisis Time . There's a feeling about myself that I can't understand It's a foreboding sense that I see all around the land . When the wheel of fortune turns progressively depraved It's the manifestation of a biospheric decay . Keep yourself in line, there's no design The new paradigm is crisis time . Luxury was privilege and I knew it all along But to let human reason get trumped by emotion is wrong . All the bonds were broken when I said I loved you so But rejection of a fantasy is just a way to help you grow . Keep yourself in line, there's no design The new paradigm is crisis time . There's a feeling about myself, I feel it oh so strong It's a romantic notion and I've thought about it far too long . On the crest of progress we can't balance on the wave If the measure of success is only tallied in the lives we save . Keep yourself in line, there's no design The new paradigm is crisis time Keep yourself in line, there's no design The new paradigm is crisis time . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
