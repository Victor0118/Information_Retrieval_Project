      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Give It To Me - Sheryl Crow . Tell me you don’t care Or tell me you’re just scared But give me something I can hold on to . Just say what’s on your mind Or am I just wasting time? If you don’t want somebody loving you . You’ve got one foot in and one foot out the door And baby I can’t take it anymore . Just give it to me Give it to me Give it to me All your love . You’ve got demons in your past You think real love doesn’t last So pull me close and then push me away . Can’t you look me in the eye? Could you scream or laugh or cry? But baby if you’re leaving say goodbye . But if you can’t find the right words anymore Well then take me up the stairs and close the door . Give it to me Just give it to me Give it to me All your love . Oh baby I’m begging you please You’ve got me down on my knees tonight I know what we have is real Please remember how it feels to us . You’ve got one foot in and one foot out the door And baby I can’t take it anymore . Give it to me Just give it to me Give it to me All your love . Give it to me Give it to me Give it to me All your love . 歌词编辑：活在當下     QQ：6313827
