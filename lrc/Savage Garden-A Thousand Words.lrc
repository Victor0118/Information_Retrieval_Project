 We stumble in a tangled web,
 decaying friendships almost dead
 And hide behind a mask of lies
 We twist and turn and we avoid,
 all hope of salvage now devoid
 I see truth inside your eyes
 So take all this noise into your brain
 and send it back again
 I'll bear the cost, shed my skin, 
 call you up and then...
 I'll say the words out loud 
 You could resurrect a thousand words 
 to deceive me more and more
 A thousand words will give the reasons 
 why I don't need you anymore 
 Time manipulates your heart,
 preconceptions torn apart
 Begin to doubt my state of mind
 But I won't go down on what I said
 I won't retract convictions read
 I may perplex, but I'm not blind
 So take all this noise into your brain
 and send it back again
 I'll bear the cost, shed my skin, 
 call you up and then...
 I'll say the words out loud 
 You could resurrect a thousand words 
 to deceive me more and more
 A thousand words will give the reasons 
 why I don't need you anymore 
 I'll say the words out loud. 
 I'll say a thousand words or more Manipulation. 
 Fabrication. Conversation.  Annihilation
 I'll say a thousand words or more
 Damnation. Frustration. Elevation.
 Procreation
 I'll say a thousand words or more 
  You could ressurect a thousand words 
  to deceive me more and more
  A thousand words will give the reasons why I don't need
  you anymore
