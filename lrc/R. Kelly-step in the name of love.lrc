 Many lovers has come, and
 Many lovers have gone.
 Similar to an old fashion song
 <<A thousand years from now
 We'll be still putting it down my baby. >>
 
 You can change the frame, 
 But the picture remains the same.
 Similar to the sun after the rain.
 <<Thousand years from now, we’ll
 Be still puttin' it down my baby>>
 
 Baby girl in other words for ever more
 I'll be here. (I'll be here).
 Cause, my whole has been full of joy every since
 You came here...Girl

 <<Goes around, goes around, goes around, goes around,>>
 <<Goes around, goes around, goes around, you spin me>>
 
 My whole world goes around, 
 Because you spin me yeah <<spin me>>
 And every time we're done making love girl
 You makes me wanna…
 
 <<Snap in the name of love, snap in the name of love>> (Snap my fingers) 
 <<Clap in the name of love>> (Clap my hands yeah) 
 <<Step in the name of love>> (Step from side to side)
 <<Groove in the name of love>> (Grooove and it's alright)
 
 Some believes in love,
 And some people don't
 Similar to a story, when it's told.
 A thousand years from now
 We’ll be still puttin’ down my baby
 Some have cross the finish line and some gave up.
 It's like moving a mountain 
 Love can be just that tough yeah.
 <<A thousand years from now>>
 <<We'll be still putting it down, my baby>>
 Baby girl in other words for ever more
 I'll be here. (I'll be here.)
 Cause my whole has been full of joy since
