  Feel the rhythm with your hands
  Steal the rhythm while you can, Spoonman
 Speak the rhythm on your own
 Speak the rhythm all alone, Spoonman
 Spoonman, come together with your hands
 Save me, I'm together with your plan
 Save me
 All my friends are Indians
 All my friends are brown and red, Spoonman
 All my friends are skeletons
 They beat the rhythm with their bones,
 Spoonman
 Thank you, good night people
