 Uhh, yeah.. mmm, c'mon
 You know how long I've been waiting for this
 
  Kiss me from (uhh) head to toe (I will)
  Oooh baby, I love you so (c'mon)
  My sweet love, ain't gon' stop (uh)
  I'm gon' be, your lollipop (lollipop)
  Kiss me from, head to toe
  Oooh baby, I love you so (I know)
  My sweet love, ain't gon' stop
  I'm gon' be, your lollipop

 Lolli-lolli-pop-pop, boppin down the block-block
 I've been lovin you since junior high, ma you got
 Everything I need, everything I want
 You're the type of dime a real player wanna flaunt
 Lovin them lips and the shape of them hips
 When I see you in that whack brother's whip, I FLIP
 I hate your boyfriend, that cat is corny
 I kick it to you and I dare that clown to run up on me
 When nights are stormy I be thinkin about your pretty smile, gritty style
 But duke got you locked down like Riker's Isle
 I wanna break your man off, I can't control it, I'm a hater
 Especially, when your perfume lingers inside the elevator
 You're the one, the only one
 That I would beg, to give me some
 Playerism's for life, eternal flossin, proceed with caution
 Baby toss him, divorce him, let the boss in

 So ballalistic, mystic, twisted
 In my dreams I kissed it, never missed it, I frisked it
 Searched it, worked it, lollipopped it and jerked it
 You followed, swallowed, scratch my back, baby burped it
 Red Passion, high fashion
 Nobody got to know I'm smashin, I'm sayin shorty
 Rock, Miss Thang, playin childish games
 Standin on the corner knowin damn well I wanna blaze
 Sweet get to it anywhere you like
 On the rooftop, at midnight
 The project stairs, I'll be there
 Runnin my fingers through your hair
 Anyway, the untouchable, magnetic
 Kissable loveable huggable energetic, call a medic
 Your man'll regret it, when I hit it I'm athletic
 Energize your thighs you'll recognize the size
 It's epidemic..

   Kiss me from (uhh) head to toe
   Oooh baby, I love you so
   My sweet love, ain't gon' stop
   I'm gon' be, your lollipop
   Kiss me from, head to toe
   Oooh baby, I love you so
   My sweet love, ain't gon' stop
   I'm gon' be, your lollipop

 When y'all alone in the Brooklyn brownstone
 Starin at the high ceiling, what a feeling
 Clothes peeling, finally you're double dealing
 I'm walkin, he's wheeling, it's unreal when
 You got the dime of your fantasies
 My lollipop ecstasy's on top of me
 Just like I thought, it's a small world after all
 I don't care if your neighbors hear us down the hall
 Make 'em jealous, what they gon' tell us?
 If you don't tell your girls baby, I won't tell the fellas
 If you don't plea, I orchestrated icebergisms
 Visions of my lollipop's thick risen, for my wisdom
 Plop plop fizzdom, what I give them
 Make - yea baby, right there - my new anthem
 I love you baby, take it deep deep deep
 Deep deep deep, now go to sleep
