 Desperate for changing
 Starving for truth
 I'm closer to where I started
 I'm chasing after you
 
 I'm falling even more in love with you
 Letting go of all I've held on to
 I'm standing here until you make me move
 I'm hanging by a moment here with you
 
 Forgetting all I'm lacking
 Completely incomplete
 I'll take your invitation
 You take all of me now
 
 I'm falling even more in love with you
 Letting go of all I've held on to
 I'm standing here until you make me move
 I'm hanging by a moment here with you
 
 I'm living for the only thing I know
 I'm running and I question where to go
 And I don't know what I'm tapping into
 Just hanging by a moment here with you
 
 There's nothing else to lose
 There's nothing else to find
 There's nothing in the world 
 That can change my mind
 There is nothing else
 There is nothing else
 There is nothing else
 
 Desperate for changing
 Starving for truth
 I'm closer to where I started
 I'm chasing after you
 
 I'm falling even more in love with you
 Letting go of all I've held on to
 I'm standing here until you make me move
 I'm hanging by a moment here with you
 
 I'm living for the only thing I know
 I'm running and I question where to go
 And I don't know what I'm tapping into
 Just hanging by a moment here with you
 
 Just hanging by a moment
 Hanging by a moment
 Hanging by a moment
 Hanging by a moment here with you
