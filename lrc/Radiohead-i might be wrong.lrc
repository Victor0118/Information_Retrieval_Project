I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I could have sworn
I saw a light coming on
I used to thinkI used to think
There is no future left at all
I used to thinkOpen up, begin again
Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times
Never look backNever look back
What would I do?What would I do?
If I did not have you..
Open up and let me in
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time
It's nothing at allNothing at all
Nothing at all
