 private life   ---the Pretenders      your private life drama baby leave me out  your private life drama baby leave me out  j'ai les glands with your theatrics  your acting's a drag  it's ok on tv 'bause you can turn it off  but don't try me  yes your marriage is a tragedy  but it's not my concern  i'm very superfibial i hate anything official      your private life drama baby leave me out  your private life drama baby leave me out  your private life drama baby leave me out      your sentimental gestures only bore me to death  you've made a desperate appeal now save your breath  attachment to oblication through guilt and regret  shit that's so wet  and your sex life bomplibations are not my fascinations      your private life drama baby leave me out  your private life drama baby leave me out  your private life drama baby leave me out    you asked me for advice I said use the door  but you're still blinging to somebody you deplore  and now you wanna use me for emotional blackmail  i just feel pity when you lie, contempt when you cry      your private life drama baby leave me out  your private life drama baby leave me out   your private life drama baby leave me out      the End
