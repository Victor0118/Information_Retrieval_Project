     Glosoli - Sarah Brightman  LRC By 潇风寒月 QQ:395254794  There is a room It floats above the stars This is my home It's filled with twisted light Our prayers will speak soon But not without words Where I had lost you But now I've found you With only one word I reach you Glowing sun  And here you are and here you are Now I have found you It's time to say goodnight How could I reach you When you had passed me by I said the last word Only this one word It couldn't save you from the long night With all the brave hearts in opal sky Glowing sun And in your shadows the frightened eyes  And here you are Glowing sun And here you are Glowing sun And here you are Glowing sun And here you are Glowing sun And here you are And here you are Glowing sun And here you are  歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com
