     to make you feel my love kelly clarkson 歌词编辑：听雨 QQ：850454409 When the rain is blowing in your face   And the whole world is on your case   I would offer you a warm embrace   To make you feel my love   When evening shadows and the stars appear   And there is no one to dry your tears   I could hold you for a million years   To make you feel my love    I know you haven't made your mind up   yet   But I would never do you wrong   I've known it from the moment that we met   There's no doubt in my mind where you belong    I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue   I'd go crawling down the avenue   There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do   To make you feel my love    The storm of rage is rolling on the sea   Down the highway of regret   The wind of rage is blowing wild and free   But you ain't seen nothing like me yet    There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do   Go to the ends of the earth for you   Make you happy, make your dreams come true   To make you feel my love    To make you feel my love lyric by rain
