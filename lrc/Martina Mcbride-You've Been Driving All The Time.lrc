      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Martina McBride – You've Been Driving All the Time . Well, I was born full speed ahead I was racin' time my mama said I really covered some ground 'til you slowed me down And took my life where angels fear to tread . Everywhere I go your hands are on the wheel When everybody thinks they're mine It takes a real man to take a backseat to a woman But honey you've been drivin' all the time . Your love's so unconditional You never push and you never pull And your love is so blind You walk a step behind You start me every day and let me roll . Everywhere I go your hands are on the wheel When everybody thinks they're mine It takes a real man to take a backseat to a woman But honey you've been drivin' all the time . And with each new day that passes by And every dream I dare to try You lift me gently up So tenderly with love And give me even stronger wings to fly . Everywhere I go your hands are on the wheel When everybody thinks they're mine It takes a real man to take a backseat to a woman But honey you've been drivin' all the time . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
