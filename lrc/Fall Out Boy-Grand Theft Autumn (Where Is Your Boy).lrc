 Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman.
 Maybe he won't find out what I know: you were the last good thing about this part of town.
 
 When I wake up, I'm willing to take my chances on the hope I forget 
 that you hate him more than you notice I wrote this for you (for you, so...)
 
 You need him. I could be him...
 I could be an accident but I'm still trying. 
 That's more than I can say for him.

 Someday I'll appreciate in value, get off my ass and call you... {but for} the meantime I'll sport my
 brand new fashion of waking up with pants on at 4:00 in the afternoon.
