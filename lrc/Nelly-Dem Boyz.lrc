  
Like ohh better get em back watch dem niggas back 
I hear dem boyz come'n dirty 
Like ohh better get em back watch dem bitches back 
I hear dem boyz come'n(repeat 4x's) 

  
Who am I you ask me you know it's bout that grammar 
From any state it don't matter, from here to Montana 
From white girls name Anna, to old ladies name Nanna 
They hold'n up they banners, and run'n wit they cameras 
Can I get a flick you damn right miss 
(Can I take a hit) here boo like this 
Chronic sticky like gum, I guess that's how it comes 
Don't worry bout my funds, I play around it in one (Like ohh) 
When you seen that hummer, but that was last summer 
this year I'm more blunter 
More up close and personal, it's just gon get worser now 
From Prada to Vokal, the Tics are too versatile 
Can't worry bout certain sounds, that come out these haters mouths 
I realize they can't help it, just stay where you bow'n down 
Some more you can't get these pounds, unless you gon smoke it now 
If not I suggest you pack yo shit up and head out of town 

  

  
They be like hold up, hold up, hold up I know that aint them man 
Murp jersey on backwards wit ol' school Tim's and 
Kyjuan got on so many colors just like a pimp 
Nelly chain so long got him walk'n wit a limp 
Ali is throw'n money in the front row 
And er' body scream'n Slo Down but where the hell is slo of course 
We be them up, close, live, and in person 
Might look like the type that be rob'n them purses 
But I aint I'm the yung dude I be rhyme'n them verses 
Worked hard since '93 that's how I got signed to Universal 
Now the girlies take they thongs off 
And it be crazy in the club when that Lunatic song go off 
I be that pull up right beside you beat'n bad type of Tic 
I'm a hold up traffic to touch her ass type of Tic 
Lunatic, that's what I am that's what I said I am 
I'm try'n to be a millionaire I bet I am, I bet I am 

  
It's dem boyz on dem porches in Air Forces read'n Sources 
My choice is ol' school's over dem Rolls Royce's 
Of course this Tic shit live like EA Sports is 
Dribble in the club I lay up wit two draft choices 
Hit the center touch the point guard, she hit the joint hard 
Ohh wee oh Lord, she don't want no more 
Cutlass is four door, stash for the 4.4 
Smokes 1 44, what dem o's go for (Like oh) 
350 1 more, 350 stick'n the floor brand new bizare 
smashes, g 's and c's all in my glasses 
Tics fantastic we get booked more than matches 
Imagine, me without those two headbands 
Them Vokal t-shirts with some 8 class pants 
Feel'n dapper like Dan yes fresh like Mannie 
Cutlass candies sit down you know you can't stand me 

  

  
Andy freeze all his fees, locks, stripy stocks, rocks in the watch 
Big shorts, headband to a cross-jersey back Ross 
That's that Mid-West talk, I think yo future boss Batter Up 
Naw cough, and let you know Caprice Classic on these hoes 
Ver big shows tell her best be on they toes 
5 country grammar boys in bandana platinum no gold like (Oh) 
That's what they say when I pull up on d's in that old Dr.J 
Hold a v a, fat laces this world is rat races 
Head'n back places but it still seem racist 
Got locations so I haul off the wall off if you could fall off 
Got a room at the Wada wit a saw that 'll take the wall off 
Hit the mall off wit a sag hockey jersey du-rag 
Fitted still switch'n two different shoes starchy wit tags
