Trapped a dragon west of Chinatown for fire-eaters up in Hollywood
My little sister took a picture of God and floated away
RIDE - downtown Los Angeles
RIDE - downtown Los Angeles
When your hands are broken
When your words are slipping
Put your arms around him
And go ... down

Hide your money in the other hand
(Observations of a regular)

Towers floating on a seat of ghosts...
It's always the same, I told you
RIDE - downtown Los Angeles
RIDE - downtown Los Angeles
