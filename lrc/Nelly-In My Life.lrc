You cant call me with no money that I never spent 
They don't make planes to go where I never went 
I aint gotta keep sinning to keep spinnin 
I prefer pink dice and peach linen 
I teach these women what they in the shirt for 
Search yours, find out you really worth more 
I change your esteem 
You was made for a king 
Do he really love you? 
He ain't give you a ring
