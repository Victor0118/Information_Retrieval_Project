 If you want it, boys, get it here thing
 'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing
 
 Is it nice in your snow storm
 Freezing your brain?
 Do you think that your face looks the same?
 Then let it be
 It's all I ever wanted
 It's a street with a deal
 And a taste
 It's got claws
 It's got me
 It's got you
