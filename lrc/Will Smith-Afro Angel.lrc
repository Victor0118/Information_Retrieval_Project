(Ooh, Ohh) 
Here I stand before you - brown. 
Color of the mountains 
Colossal as the earth 
Wrapped so deliciously within my own joy and misery 
Feathers of my wings paralyzed by the distance of my mind 
Here I stand before you, the color of the night 
Frozen by the potential of me 
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh) An Afro Angel 

Afro Angel off your pedestal from perchin above 
You on the prowl now, downtown, searchin for love 
In all the wrong places, outside your radio stations 
Hopin he with new hit single, is tryin to mingle 
Today, he is in your town, puttin it down 
You in the car with your friends, followin my limo around 
Puttin a bug in my boy's ear, your "S" is for free 
You'll do anything for Omar or Phil, bring you to me 
And then me, hypnotized by the devil as well 
Hold out my hand as an invitation into my hotel 
No need to RSVP, place your hand in my palm 
As all your girlfriends getting jealous, damn she landed the bomb 
Willing to trade your spirit for some crass, whack wage 
Something small, something simple as a pass back stage 
But now I lay me, down to creep 
And I - pray the Lord my soul to keep 

Chorus: 
Afro Angel, born against the world 
You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride 
Afro Angel, sent from heaven above 
Never forget that you are loved 
You know that you are loved 

Lil Bobby got a gun now, age fifteen 
Destined to spend his life inside a cage it seems 
Rage inside, pride, been denied respect 
He can't take it though he gotta earn it 
But he ain't learned that yet 
Out on the town, reckless abandon he's been bullied before 
But now he straps, and no more 
Attitude high 
Flexin on every guy that walk by 
But don't start pal 
Cuz if the gun came from the whiz, Cowardly Lion, got heart now 
Let's pull it on a stranger 
Ahh, fun for the crew 
Surprised when he realized, damn dude got one too 
Smile's upside down now, games ain't so cute 
Bobby's a deer in a headlights 
Pump, drop it or I'll shoot 
Then like a sniper, cleanin his rifle, Bobby disobeys his commands 
One shot rings out (gunshot) then only the stranger stands 
Could of sworn Bobby's blood formed the shape of an angel's wings 
But for what? 

Chorus: 
Afro Angel, born against the world 
You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride 
Afro Angel, sent from heaven above 
Never forget that you are loved 
You know that you are loved 

Back in high school, Tamika was the sweetest, the bomb 
Hot to death, though in tenth grade a teenage mom 
Knocked up by some thug named Russ in the drug game 
But had the cutest kid you ever seen 
Then all the pressure from her mom 
She stepped to Russ 
Told him it's either them drugs or us 
Either them thugs or us 
The ultimatum, either continue bein a thug in the world 
Or start lovin your girl 
And say God, bear me witness, no doubt, lovin ya dear 
But to go from $50 Gees a week to $30 Gees a year 
That ain't happenin 
I guess he wasn't that strong 
He came back the next week, and the whole family was gone 
Yo they straight moved away, without as little as a word 
Well, needless to say, Russ was a little perturbed 
Then in a fury put the pressure on her girlfriend Shawn 
And like a clumsy chef she spilled the beans on where they had gone 

Upstate Schenectady, 
Tamika answered the door 
It was the last person she expected to be 
They just stared 
He said you love me for me? 
You can do without the cars, vacations, and jewelry? 
Down with me? 
Period. 
Through life's stress and strife 
She said, Yeah, He said in that case 
Would you please be my wife? 
Then like a sign from the sky, the baby cried 
Like an angel sings 
I love y'all more than anything 

Chorus: 
Afro Angel, born against the world 
You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride 
Afro Angel, sent from heaven above 
Never forget that you are loved 
You know that you are loved 

(Repeat Chorus)
