 frente  shape  sit on my hands  in my life,  wasted  opinion,  distracted  basically growing like vegetable  stowing the secret i already know  one victim  reaction  waiting,   wasting  i sit on the table  my life in a blink  my head is revolting  i shudder to think  i sit on my hands  youve taken my silence as total compliance  how could you feel any other way?  im spending my life and youre reading my lines out  why did i tell you how i play it?  wondering what if i crashed into feeling  could i get away with it? youve stolen my wallet with all of my soul in it picking my pieces and pissing in my pocket  i like you  we cant see  i wish i could wake up  youve stolen my wallet with all of my soul in it  picking my pieces and pissing in my pocket  sit on my hands  i sit on my hands  how could you feel any other way?  im spending my life and youre reading my lines out  why did i tell you how i play it?  youve taken my silence as total compliance  how could you feel any other way?  wondering what if i crashed into silence  could i get away with it  i like you
