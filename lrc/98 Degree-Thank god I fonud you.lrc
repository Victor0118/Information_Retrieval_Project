Thank God I Found You
           

           
            I would give up everything
            Before I'd separate myself from you
            After so much suffering
            I finally found the unvernished truth
            I was all by myself for the longest time
            So cold inside
            And the hurt from the heart it would not subside
            I felt like dying
            Until you saved my life

            Thank God I found you
            I was lost without you
            My every wish and every dream
            Somehow became reality
            When you brought the sunlight
            Completed my whole life
            I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
            Cause baby I'm so thankful
            I found you

            I would give you everything
            There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
            To ensure your happiness
            I'll cherish every part of you
            Because without you beside me I can't survive
            I don't wanna try
            If you're keeping me warm each and every night I'll be all right
            Cause I need you in my life

             

            See I was so desolate
            Before you came to me
            Looking back I guess it shows
            that we were destined to shine
            After the rain to appreciate
            And care for what we have
            And I'd go through it all over again
            To be able to feel this way

             

            Thank God I found you
            I was lost without you
            I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
            My baby I'm so thankful
            I found you

            I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
            My baby I'm so thankful I found you
