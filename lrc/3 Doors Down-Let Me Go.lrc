 One more kiss could be the best thing
 Or one more lie could be the worst
 And all these thoughts are never resting
 And your not something I deserve
 
CHORUS
 In my head there's only you now
 This world falls on me
 In this world there's real and make believe
 And this seems real to me
 And you love me but you don't know who I am
 I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
 And you love me but you don't know who I am
 So let me go, let me go
 
 I dream ahead to what I hope for
 And I turn my back on loving you
 How can this love be a good thing
 And I know what I'm going through
 
CHORUS
 In my head there's only you now
 This world falls on me
 In this world there's real and make believe
 And this seems real to me
 And you love me but you don't know who I am
 I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
 And you love me but you don't know who I am
 So let me go, just let me go, let me go
 
 And no matter how hard I try
 I can't escape these things inside
 I know, I know
 But all the pieces fall apart
 You will be the only one who knows, who knows
 
 You love me but you don't know who I am
 I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
 And you love me but you don't know who I am
 So let me go, just let me go
 (you don't know)
 You love me but you don't
 You love me but you don't
 (you don't know)
 You love me but you don't know who I am
 (you don't know)
 You love me but you don't
 You love me but you don't
 (you don't know)
 You love me but you don't know me
