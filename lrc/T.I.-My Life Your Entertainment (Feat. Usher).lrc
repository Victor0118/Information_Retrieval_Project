 Hey, hey
 Hey what's happenin' e'erybody
 I hope they get my good side
 You know I gotta look good when I walk out the house
 You know I know the camera's following
 I know they taking pictures, right Drama
 Ay man, you watch it I live it, you dig that
 Y'all sit back relax get some popcorn man
 I'm gonna make it a good show, you dig that
 This goin' make a hell of a movie huh
 
 My life, your entertainment
 You watch it while I live it (live it)
 I walk they follow (ay)
 I talk they holla (ay)
 Just here for your amusement
 My life, your entertainment
 You watch it while I live it (live it)
 You waitin' for me to lose it
 I guess I'm just here for your amusement
 
 The price of fame I think I paid, want my change I done gave
 E'erything in my possession for my seconds on the stage
 For my name up in lights and multi-million record sales
 I done gave up my life, can't get a moment to myself
 When alone I ask myself, is it worth it? I ain't perfect
 Neither is anybody else, but I think my kids deserve
 To be with Daddy out in public without all the interruptions
 When the lies and gossip's published I'm the topic of discussion
 And I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I ain't lost it
 And I'd do it all again that's the funny thing about it
 I ain't playing, boy I'm 'bout it
 Will I change, boy I doubt it
 I done been a lot of things, I ain't never been a coward
 See the paparazzi crowded all around me now
 Same niggas who was dissin' want a pound like I'm C now
 Showered with support from my adoring fans
 They hear T.I.'s arrested they're like here we go again
 
 My life, your entertainment
 You watch it while I live it (live it)
 I walk they follow (ay)
 I talk they holla (ay)
 Just here for your amusement
 My life, your entertainment
 You watch it while I live it (live it)
 You waitin' for me to lose it
 I guess I'm just here for your amusement
 
 You've seen it all before, guys know how the story goes
 It's like 2Pac never died, sit back, enjoy the show
 You see the shit that scares you senseless, I done lived through it
 Knew the risks and the consequences and I still do it
 And then I'm so fresh, them niggas mildew it
 Not just a actor by profession, pimp, I live movies
 That's why they whisper when they see me, point and stare at me
 'Cause they just wanna live through me vicariously
 Fashion weekend, Paris week, party like a rockstar
 Get blown by a top model 'til she catch lockjaw
 Got the dough you get a year, stashed in my sock drawer
 Showed you the troubles and the struggles of an outlaw
 Top dog would not fall, I am not y'all
 Couple pages out the calendar and I'm out y'all
 Kid listen, pay attention, you don't wanna be me
 It's safer to watch it on T.V.
 
 My life, your entertainment
 You watch it while I live it (live it)
 I walk they follow (ay)
 I talk they holla (ay)
 Just here for your amusement
 My life, your entertainment
 You watch it while I live it (live it)
 You waitin' for me to lose it
 I guess I'm just here for your amusement
 
 See I don't think it would even matter (to me)
 Woking a nine to (five) would it be better
 I mean be honest, would you care to gossip about me
 Not likely
 I guess that's just the way that it goes (the way that it goes)
 ('Cause I know) See I can be somewhere out keeping it cool
 (And get told) Almost anything instead of the truth
 Y'all know more than I do, it's breaking news to me too
 Easy killer y'all know that ain't how I move (ooh)
 He said and she said (what) I did what, with they (who)
 No not me I said (not me) she gave me no head (ooh)
 Won't get me again (hey) I pleaded the fifth (hey)
 I know better than to ever talk during the film...
 in' and flashing lights can blind your eyesight
 To when you cant see what's wrong from right
 Well shorty 'til you walk a mile in my shoes
 And understand this is who I am
 Usher I completely concur
 Life can be such a blur, obviously we prefer
 Our privacy but instead we endure
 Yes sir, don't expect nothin' less of me
 'Cause this goin' probably be this way until the death of me
 But for the hustle and the lady on my arm now
 Plus all my kids and my mom's I'm a calm down
 And yo, we doin' just fine, and the time's just flyin'
 Live one headline at a time

 My life, your entertainment

 You waitin' for me to lose it
 I guess I'm just here for your amusement
