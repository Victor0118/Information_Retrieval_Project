     Blue Ocean Floor Justin Timberlake  LRC by Mr.Lei QQ：395254794  Frequency so low held on a string A string that only plays solos Rain made of echoes Tidal wave rushing on and on  Under the water you scream so loud But the silence surrounds you But I hear it loud when you fall in the deep and I'll always find you  If my red eyes dont see you anymore And I can't hear you through the white noise Just send your heart beat, I'll go To the blue ocean floor Where they'll find us no more On the Blue Ocean Floor On the Blue Ocean Floor On the Blue Ocean Floor On the Blue Ocean Floor On the Blue Ocean Floor  Shell made out of gold Found on a beach picked up in your hand held so close Rain washed out its glow, heart beat steady leads me down below And under the water you scream so loud But the silence surrounds But I hear it loud when you fall in the deep and ill always find you  If my red eyes dont see you anymore And I cant hear you through the white noise Just send your heart beat, ill go To the blue ocean floor Where theyll find us no more  On the Blue Ocean Floor On the Blue Ocean Floor On the Blue Ocean Floor On the Blue Ocean Floor On the Blue Ocean Floor  20,000 leagues away catch up to you on the same day Travel at the speed of light thinking the same thought at the same time Heartbeat's at a steady pace, i'll let the rhythym show me the way No one can find us here, fade out and dissapear  If my red eyes dont see you anymore And I cant hear you through the white noise Just send your heart beat, ill go to the blue ocean floor Where theyll find us no more On the Blue Ocean Floor On the Blue Ocean Floor On the Blue Ocean Floor On the Blue Ocean Floor On the Blue Ocean Floor  歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com
