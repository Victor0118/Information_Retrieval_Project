 I wore cologne to get the feeling right
 We started makin' out and she took off my pants
 But then, I turned on the TV
 And that's about the time she walked away from me
 Nobody likes you when you're 23
 And are still more amused by TV shows
 What the hell is ADD, my friends say I should act my age
 What's my age again?
 What's my age again?
 Then later on, on the drive home
 I called her mom from a pay phone
 I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
 This state looks down on sodomy
 And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
 Nobody likes you when you're 23
 And are still more amused by prank phone calls
 What the hell is call ID, my friends say I should act my age
 What's my age again?
 What's my age again?
 And that's about the time she walked away from me
 Nobody likes you when you're 23
 And you still act like you're in freshman year
 What the hell is wrong with me, my friends say I should act my age
 What's my age again?
 That's about the time that she broke up with me (what's my age again?)
 No one should take themselves so seriously
 With many years ahead to fall in line
 Why would you wish that on me, I'll never wanna act my age
 What's my age again?
 What's my age again?
 What's my age again...
