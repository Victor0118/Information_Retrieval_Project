Morning bell
Morning bell
Light another candle
Release meRelease me
You can keep the furniture
A bump on the headcoming down the chimney
Release meRelease me
Yeah......Release me
Release meWhere'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are all over the furniture
And I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around around around around around....
Cut the kids in half (x3)
