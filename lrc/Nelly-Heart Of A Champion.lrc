C'mon, uhh, uhh 
I guess he's back 'urr derrty, S-T-L derby 
I'm like Magic to Kareem, mayne you tell me I ain't Worthy 
I ain't speakin 'bout a jersey, I'm speakin 'bout income 
DID YOU HEAR THAT ELIZABETH? HERE COME THE BIG ONE! 
I put mo' money in the community than you got in yo' budget 
I wipe my ass with yo' advance to the toilet then flush it 
My last stance be a stance of a General Custard 
I hot dog cause I can, I got the cheese and mustard 
I got the stats of a hall of famer - in just two records 
That's why I'm back up at the Superbowl - with Julius Peppers 
I got that cain't stop, won't stop, in my veins 
That's why they cain't stop, won't stop, screamin the name 
NELLY! NELLY! Go tell a friend to tell a friend 
I'ma keep the same grin whether I, lose or win 
Up, or down ten, I'ma fight to the end 
  Let's go 

  
Ain't no way they can stop me now Nelly 
Cause I'm on my way, I can feel my ring comin 
It's the blood of a champion, pumpin 
Deep inside my veins, too much pride to be runnin 
I'ma get what I can and more, even if 
My blood, my sweat, and my tears don't mean nothin 
It's the heart of a champion (it's the heart of me) 
(It's the heart of a..) in me 

  
I'm the first pick, the first round, signin bonus profound 
Playin for his hometown, reppin for the home ground 
And gettin buffer like Michael Riggs, tell 'em again 
I gets buffer like Michael Riggs, heard what I said? 
The MV-P of the game, intensity still the same 
I'm shootin out from my reign, with Peyton Manning type aim 
Can't stop me from scorin so they results are just hackin 
So there's, three of us now - me, A.I. and Shaq'n 
From the look to the as I say 
Hover man with more heart than Hallmark on Valentine's Day 
I'm the one that you've been Raven about, like Ray Lewis 
I think it hard to go and change your route 
Cause you don't know if I'm blitzin or if I'm sittin and readin 
Waitin for you to go and trip, drop back and throw up a brick, man 
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW 
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW 

  

  
It's like a big time decision made on how I can twurk it 
If hard work pays off then easy work is worthless 
My work habit ain't no habit man, I do it on purpose 
I push myself to the limit so my talent'll surface 
So now it's, curtains and drapes, on anybody who hates 
Dislikin what I'm recitin, bitin what I've been writin 
I've been dogfightin, scratchin and clawin on every height 
Tryin to make you remember me like you +Remember the Titans+ 
Cause I'm a WARR-IOR, my daddy was a soldier 
A Vietnam vet, lil' derrty I thought I told ya 
I'm supposed ta, whip up your town in Testarossas 
Heatin like Folgers mayne, I'm young black and rich 
As good as it gets, and givin your point guard fits 
He think he done seen pressure mayne, but he ain't seen shhhh... 
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW 
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW
