 Daddy's flown across the ocean
 Leaving just a memory
 A snapshot in the family album
 Daddy what else did you leave for me?
 Daddy, what'd'ja leave behind for me?!?
 All in all it was just a brick in the wall.
 All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.
 
"You! Yes, you! Stand still laddy!"
