 I see a red door and I want it painted black
 No colors anymore, I want them to turn black
 I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
 I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
 
 I see a line of cars and they are painted black
 With flowers and my love both never to come back
 I see people turn their heads, they quickly look away
 Like a new born baby it just happens every day 
 
 I look inside myself and see my heart is black
 I see my red door and it's heading into black
 Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
 It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black
 I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black, oh baby
 I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black, oh baby
 
 No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
 I could not foresee this thing happening to you
 If I look hard enough into the setting sun
 My love will laugh with me before the morning comes
 
 I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black
 Oh, black as night black as coal
 I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
 Painted, painted, painted black, oh baby
 Painted, painted, painted black
 
 
 END
