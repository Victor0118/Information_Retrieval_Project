 Do Do Do Do, Do Do    Love washed out  The colors fade  Love so red  Is now pase  Never found  A pot of gold  At the of all my rainbows    Blue afternoon  Nothin' to do  Wonderin' why I'm feelin'  Blue afternoon  Thinking of you  Wonderin why I cry on  My blue afternoon    Case of love  Is what we'll be  I engulge  In sweet envy  Sand is tinged  With streams of gold  But, I've been told  That on a rainbow    Blue afternoon  Nothin' to do  Wonderin' why I'm feelin'  Blue afternoon  Thinking of you  Wonderin why I cry on  My blue afternoon    I can continue  Can't give it up  Why can't they  So I'd live it up  My feelings  Will they ever stop  For you  For you...    Love came back  In shape of you  And now my afternoon  Is blue  Everywhere  I look is gold  At the of every rainbow    Blue afternoon (Blue) (Afternoon)  Everything's new (Everything's new)  Suddenly I'm not feelin'  Blue anymore (anymore)  Never again (Never again)  Never say, "Go away"  Go away  Go away  You blue afternoon    END
