  I just want to be happy again
 I just want to feel deep in my own world
 but I'm so lonely I don't even want to be with myself anymore
 On a different day if I was safe in my own skin
 then I wouldn't feel so lost and so frightened
 But this is today and I'm lost in my own skin
 And I'm so lonely I don't even want to be with myself anymore
