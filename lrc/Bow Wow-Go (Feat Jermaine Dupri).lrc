 If you don't wanna dance
 I can find me somebody else that do, do
 If you don't wanna dance
 What you here for girl you need to move, move
 If you don't wanna dance
 Than it best you turn this off right now
 Cuz I am the B-O-W-W-O-W
 And it's about to
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 It's about to
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 I choose you, I choose you
 Lil kids love me like Santa Clause
 And I'm under 21 wit a Phantom ??
 Mane dressed like big
 I called the play
 Run, pass, shorty I can hand it off
 You know I run wit a crew that ain't ever lost
 We young, we rich
 And we love to floss
 You gotta pay the cost
 To hear me breathe
 Bow Wow representin that DPG
 26 inch chrome
 With a lake front home
 Heavy in the hood, like straighenin combs
 I can have any girl in this world that I want
 But I choose you, I choose you
 
 If you don't wanna dance
 I can find me somebody else that do, do
 If you don't wanna dance
 What you here for girl you need to move, move
 If you don't wanna dance
 Than it best you turn this off right now
 Cuz I am the B-O-W-W-O-W
 And it's about to
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 It's about to
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 I choose you, I choose you
 Bow Wow still holdin the top spot
 Roll in the hot drops
 Been in control since I came out the bow
 And I sell like rocks in the 80's
 Number one just like Tracy McGrady
 This young thug
 Can't non yall see me, fade me
 keep cash money like Baby
 I'm crazy
 If I must say so
 And I lust for the dough
 Push em everytime I bust my flow
 I'm a blessed young man
 And the best young man that you very heard rock befo
 I can have any girl that in this world that I want
 But I choose you, I choose you
 But ugh
 If you don't wanna dance
 I can find me somebody else that do, do
 If you don't wanna dance
 What you here for girl you need to move, move
 If you don't wanna dance
 Than it best you turn this off right now
 Cuz I am the B-O-W-W-O-W
 And it's about to
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 It's about to
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 I choose you, I choose you
 Bow Wow lemme get some
 I'm the wrong one for you to be tryin to race wit
 Face it dog
 Ain't no replacement
 I made a few mill off
 Somethin that I started in the basement
 Yall shoulda never lemme taste it
 Back when niggas was wearin Asics
 I ain't just do it, I aced it
 I'm rich but I'm still tryin to chase it
 That's why everything I do I lace it
 2 Bently's
 A hundred grand for the braclet
 To you that's a alot but to me that's basic
 And it's so many girls out there
 But I choose you, I choose you
 But ugh
  If you don't wanna dance
  I can find me somebody else that do, do
  If you don't wanna dance
  What you here for girl you need to move, move
  If you don't wanna dance
  Than it best you turn this off right now
  Cuz I am the B-O-W-W-O-W
  And it's about to
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 It's about to
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 Go, go, go, go (down)
 I choose you, I choose you
 Go go go go ......
 I choose you
