     Fake Your Death 演唱：My Chemical Romance  ◎歌词编辑:潇风寒月◎  Some people watch, some people pray But even lights can fade away Some people hope, some people pay But why we have to stay Cause even here, we're scared to bruise Or any misery you choose You like to watch, we like to use And we were born to lose I choose defeat, I walk away And leave this place for sane today Some like to sleep, we like to play Just look at all that pain You want the heart and to be saved But even good guys still get paid So watch your back and keep the blade I think it got you laid So fake your death, oh it's your blame And leave the lights on when you stay Take off your clothes and dream and fade Come on and feel that shame I choose defeat, I walk away And leave this place for sane today We like to sleep, we like to play Just look at all that pain Just look at all that pain Just look at all that pain Just look at all that pain Just give me all that pain Just give me all that pain Just give me all that pain I choose defeat, I walk away And leave this place for sane today Some like to sleep, we like to play Just look at all that pain 歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com
