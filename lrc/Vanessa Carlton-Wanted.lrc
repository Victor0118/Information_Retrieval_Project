 I have wandered, far and wide
 for something real, some thing to die for
 but I have found you, and you do not see
 All that is me, all that is true
 I am more than you will see,
 I am more than you will need,
 I am more than you will see,
 More than wanted 
 
 As you float the flimsy surface
 You should know life lies beneath it
 And don't pretend you feel what I feel
 You live illusion and I'm real
 I am more than you will see,
 I am more than you will need, 
 I am more than you will see,
 More than wanted...
 
 I know, I know
 You like that way you feel
 When I play
 I know, I know
 You don't really hear
 What I say
 I know, I know
 You are waiting 
 For something to raid
 I know,  I know
 You wish you could be
 More than you say
 
 I have wandered, far and wide
 for something real, some thing to die for
 but I have found you, and you do not see
 All that is me, all that is true
 I am more than you will see,
 I am more than you will need, 
 I am more than you will see,
 More than wanted
 I am more than you will see,
 I am more than you will need, 
 I am more than you will see,
 More than wanted
 More than you'll love
 More than you'll hate
 More than you'll hold
 More than wanted
 More than you'll crave
 More than you'll cherish
 More than you'll have
 More than wanted
