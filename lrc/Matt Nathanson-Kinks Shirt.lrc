      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Kinks Shirt - Matt Nathanson . Rent love, run in circles. Sweet fiction silhouette. Meet me at 9th and Irving, Let's do things we can both regret. . It's all there in your chipped red fingernails.  It's all there in the twist of your pigtails. . It's the way she walks, The way she talks, Can't stop thinking about that girl in the kinks shirt. Take me home, to San Francisco. Can't stop thinking about that girl in the kinks shirt. You and my imagination, You and my imagination, You and my imagination, Can't stop thinking about that girl in the kinks shirt. . Sidewalk mariachis, I see you in your party dress. Played out Sid and Nancy, Bring on the apocalypse. . Don't need no songs playing on the radio,  I get my truth from your thrift store halo. . It's the way she walks, The way she talks, Can't stop thinking about that girl in the kinks shirt. Take me home, to San Francisco. Can't stop thinking about that girl in the kinks shirt. You and my imagination, You and my imagination, You and my imagination, Can't stop thinking about that girl in the kinks shirt. . Getting what you want can break your heart. Getting what you want can break your heart. Getting what you want, it's gonna break you, it's gonna break you It's gonna break your heart. . It's the way she walks, The way she talks, Can't stop thinking about that girl in the kinks shirt. Take me home, to San Francisco. Can't stop thinking about that girl in the kinks shirt. You and my imagination, You and my imagination, You and my imagination, Can't stop thinking about that girl in the kinks shirt.  Can't stop thinking about that girl in the kinks shirt. Can't stop thinking about that girl in the kinks shirt. . 歌词编辑：活在當下     QQ：6313827
