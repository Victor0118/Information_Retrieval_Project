         Where is the line with you
 My purse wide open
 You ask again
 I see the crime-ridden
 Cash into accounts
 Everywhere
 I want to be flexible
  I want to go out of my way for you
  But enough is enough
   
 I am elastic
 I want to help you
 I want to have capacity for you
 And be elastic, elastic, to be elastic for you
 I'm elastic for you
