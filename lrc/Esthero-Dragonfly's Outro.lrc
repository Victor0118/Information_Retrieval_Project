 Find me, find me in an open sky
 And then wish me, 
 wish me far from you and free
 
  Swallow whole the love I give you, 
  then give it back to me
  Tell me, what am I supposed to do 
  with the mess you've made out of me?
  Dragonfly, Dragonfly
  
 Give me, give me back my wings so I can fly
 And then catch me, 
 catch each breath right from me when you smile
