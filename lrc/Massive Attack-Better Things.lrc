 (vowles, del naja, marshall, thorn, watt, brown)
 
Tracy Thorn
 Don't drag me down
 Just because you're down
 And just cause you're blue
 Don't make me too
 And though you've found
 You need more than me
 Don't talk to me
 About being free
 That's freedom without love
 And magic without love
 Magic without love
 
 Hear me say
 Better things will surely come our way
 Hear me say
 Better things will surely come our way
 
 You say the magic's gone
 Well i'm not a magician
 You say the spark's gone
 Well get an electrician
 And save your line about needing to be free
 All that's bullshit babe
 You just want rid of me
 You want freedom without love
 And magic without love
 Magic without love
 Yeah
 
 Hear me say
 Better things will surely come my way
 Hear me say
 Better things will surely come my way
 
 
 END
