      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Lisa Loeb - Weak Day . Got a house on my back pushing me over making me weak on my feet . And a head on my shoulders makes me uneasy making me dizzy for weeks . You got me on a weak day you got me at a bad time to talk. A screw loose and rolling into a pile in the corner I thought I should warn you . I got a shark at my ankles hung by a tightrope I'm scrappy/unhappy again . And that I'll never last like this it makes me too tired I'm loaded on vodka, two straws and soda . You got me on a weak day  you got me on a bad time to talk but you got me on a weak day you got me at the worst time of all . I'm on over filled up and far gone I tried to warn you, but that's not my job 'cause somebody took me down from on the top shelf it couldn't get worse I say to myself and I've got my head screwed on so tight it hurts sometimes it don't work so I got the prescription to take the time off make it unravel go out and travel for days bring back my stories stopping your worries I'm trying to keep them at bay . You got me on a weak day it's such a bad time to talk you caught me on a weak day you got me at the worst time of all . Get me when I'm soft and my shoes falling off, and I'll make my way back again . But you got me on a weak day you got me at the worst time of all I'm not feelin' well I'm cracked like a bell I'm shot like a shell to pieces. . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
