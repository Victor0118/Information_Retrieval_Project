 
 
 
 
 In my dreams I'm dying all the time
          
 As I wake it's kaleidoscopic mind
 I never meant to hurt you
 I never meant to lie
 So this is goodbye
 This is goodbye
 Tell the truth you never wanted me
 Tell me
 In my dreams I'm jealous all the time
 As I wake I'm going out of my mind
 Going out of my mind
