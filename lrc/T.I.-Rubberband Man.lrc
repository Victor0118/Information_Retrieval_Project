 Stack and crumble bread

 Gangstas who been servin

 Went down, did 10

 That's why i'm young
 wit the soul of a old man
 I'm shell shocked, get shot

 Still ride around
 with the glock on patrol man.
 I ain't robbing,
 I'm just lookin for that dro man.
 For ma niggas slangin blow, pimpin hos
 Rollin vogues, 24s.
 Let these other niggas know.
