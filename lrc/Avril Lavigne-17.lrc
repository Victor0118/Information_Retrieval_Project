     17 - Avril Lavigne  Lrc By 潇风寒月 QQ:395254794  He was working at the record shop I would kiss him in the parking lot tasting like cigarettes and soda pop Seventeen  He would tell me I was beautiful sneaking in the neighbours swimming pool yeah, he'd tell me how to play the rules seventeen  Hey, those days are long gone but when I hear this song it takes me back We were on top of the world back when I was your girl we were living so wild and free Acting stupid for fun all we needed was love that's the way it's supposed to be seventeen  Stealing beers out of the trailer park flicking lighters just to fight the dark my favourite place was sitting in this car seventeen  Record breaking on the rooftop that time I knew I wouldn't make it stop my hands were cold but you kept them hot seventeen  Hey, those days are long gone and when I hear this song it takes me back We were on top of the world back when I was your girl we were living so wild and free Acting stupid for fun all we needed was love that's the way it's supposed to be  We were running red lights we were going all night didn't care about anything we were living the dream baby you and me And we were seventeen  Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhhhh  I remember what it felt like Just a small town kind of life If only I could just go back in time seventeen We were on top of the world back when I was your girl we were living so wild and free acting stupid for fun all we needed was love that's the way it's supposed to be  We were running red lights we were going all night didn't care about anything We were living the dream baby you and me And we were seventeen  Seventeen seventeen seventeen  歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com
