 Oh it's healing bang bang bang
 I can hear your canons call
 You've been aiming at my land
 Your hungry hammer's falling
 And if you want me, I'm your country
 
 I'm an angel bored like hell
 And you're a devil meaning well
 You steal my lines and you strike me down
 Come raise your flag upon me
 And if you want me, I'm your country
 If you win me I'm forever, oh yeah
 
 Cause you're the storm that I believe in
 And all this peace has been deceiving
 I like the sweet life and the silence
 But it's the storm that I believe in
 
 Come and conquer, drop your bones
 Cross my borders and kill the calm
 Bury your things and burn my winds
 I hear bullets singing
 And if you want me, I'm your country
 If you win me I'm forever, oh yeah
 
 Cause you're the storm that I believe in
 And all this peace has been deceiving
 I need some wind to get me sailing
 So it's the storm that I believe in
 
 You feel my heart you keep me breathing
 Cause you're the storm that I believe in
 
 And if you want me, I'm your country
 
 
 END
