     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Love Was New(Alternate Vocal Version) - Chicago Remember when we were first falling in love How we planned all the things we would do  Beautiful days and the nights all ablaze Hoping our dreams would come true  Love was new  Remember the house at the top of the hill  How the sunlight caressed all the trees  I played all my music I sang you my love  The chiming church bells rode the breeze  Love was new  Time has a way of obscuring our memories  And good times are hard to recall  Basic survival and day to day living Leaves no time for romance at all  I just wanted to say I'm still falling in love Every day with you, every day Remember that Christmas with just a few friends And the whole town was covered with snow  We laughed and we loved as we skied in the sun  It seems such a long time ago  Love was new  Something you said one night started me thinking How sweet love is as it begins  Taken for granted it slips through your fingers  And leaves you on needles and pins  But there ain't no way baby that we'd let that happen  Our love will always be new  I just wanted to say I'm still falling in love  Every day with you,  every day with you  陈先生 QQ：1552195557
