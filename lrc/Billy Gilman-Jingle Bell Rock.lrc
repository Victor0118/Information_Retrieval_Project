 Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
 Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
 Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
 Now the jingle hop has begun
 Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
 Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
 Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
 In the frosty air
 What a bright time, it's the right time
 To rock the night away
 Jingle bell time is a swell time
 To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
 Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
 Jingle around the clock
 Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
 That's the jingle bell rock
 
 What a bright time, it's the right time
 To rock the night away
 Jingle bell time is a swell time
 To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
 Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
 Jingle around the clock
 Mix and a-mingle in the jingling beat
 That's the jingle bell,
 That's the jingle bell,
 That's the jingle bell rock.
