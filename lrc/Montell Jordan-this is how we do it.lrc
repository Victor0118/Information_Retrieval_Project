 
 
 
 This is how we do it
  
 La la la la la la la
 La la lo lo lo lo oh
  
 La la la la oh
 This is how we do it, it's Friday night
 And I feel all right
 The party's here on the West side
 So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
 Designated driver take the keys to my truck
 Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
 Honeys in the street say, "Monty, yo we made it!"
 It feels so good in my hood tonight
 The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
 All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by
 You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
 So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
 And let me hear the party say
 I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because  
 South Central does it like nobody does  
 To all my neighbours you got much flava  
 Let's flip the track, bring the old school back  
 This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
 And wave them from here to there
 If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna-be playa
 You see the hood's been good to me
 Ever since I was a lower-case G
 But now I'm a big G, the girls see I got the money
 Hundred dollar bills y'all
 If you were from where I'm from then you would know
 That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
 You can get yours in a '64
 Whatever it is, the party's underway
 So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
 And let me hear the party say
 I'm kinda buzzed, it's all because  
 Ooh South Central does it like nobody does  
 To all my neighbours you got much flava  
 Let's flip the track, bring the old school back  
 I'm kinda buzzed, it's all because  
 South Central does it like nobody does, nobody does  
 YNV, SCC,   all my homies
 I'll never come wack on an old school track  
 Check it out!
 Once upon a time in '94
 Montell made no money and life sure was slow
 All they said was 6'8" he stood
 And people thought the music that he made was good
 There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
 He came up to Monty, this is what he said
 You and OG are gonna make some cash
 Sell a million records and we'll make in a dash
 Oh I'm buzzing because  
 South Central does it like nobody does  
 To all my neighbours you got much flava  
 I'll never come wack on an old school track  
 I'm kinda buzzed, it's all because  
 South Central does it like nobody does, nobody does  
 Oh it's party time  
 Straight up comin' from the West side  
 OG's got the flava, yeah  
 And Monty doesn't like nobody, doesn't  
 Come on now, Def Jam, you know what it  
 This is how we do it   baby
