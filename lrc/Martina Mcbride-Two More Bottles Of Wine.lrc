      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Martina McBride – Two More Bottles of Wine . We came out west together with a common desire The fever we had might-a set the west coast on fire Two months later got a troublin' mind 'Cause my baby moved out and left me behind But it's all right 'cause it's midnight and I got two more bottles of wine . Well, the way he left sure turned my head around Seemed like over night he just up and put me down Ain't gonna let it bother me today 'Cause I've been workin' and I'm too tired anyway But it's all right 'cause it's midnight and I got two more bottles of wine . Well, I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know I've been doin' all I can but opportunity sure comes slow I'd be out in the sun all day But I've been sweepin' out a warehouse in West L.A. But it's all right 'cause it's midnight and I got two more bottles of wine . Well, I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know I've been doin' all I can but opportunity sure comes slow I'd be out in the sun all day But I've been sweepin' out a warehouse in West L.A. But it's all right 'cause it's midnight and I got two more bottles of wine Yes, it's all right 'cause it's midnight and I got two more bottles of wine . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
