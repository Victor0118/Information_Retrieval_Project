 Acting stupid, getting d with my best friends
 I couldn't wait for the summer at the Warped Tour
 I remember that it's the first time that I saw her there
 
 She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing
 I'm kinda nervous, cause I think all her friends hate me
 She's the one, she'll always be there
 She took my hand and I made it, I swear
 Cause I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
 She said, "What?" I told her that I didn't know
 She's so cool, better sneak me in through the window
 Everything's better when she's around
 Can't wait until her parents go out of town
 I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
 
 When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
 I remember the look her mother gave us
 Seventeen without a purpose or direction
 We don't owe anyone a fuckin' explanation
 Cause I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
 She said, "What?" I told her that I didn't know
 She's so cool, better sneak me in through the window
 Everything's better when she's around
 Can't wait until her parents go out of town
 I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
 Black and white pictures of her on my wall
 I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting
 And if I ever got another chance I'd still ask her to dance
 Because she kept me waiting
 Cause I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
 She said, "What?" I told her that I didn't know
 She's so cool, better sneak me in through the window
 Everything's better when she's around
 Can't wait until her parents go out of town
 I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
 
 With the girl at the rock show
 
 With the girl at the rock show
 
 With the girl at the rock show
 
 With the girl at the rock show
 
 With the girl at the rock show
 
 With the girl at the rock show
 
 With the girl at the rock show
