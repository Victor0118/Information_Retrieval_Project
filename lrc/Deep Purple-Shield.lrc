Mama plays a queen on the hill built on a dream
While the children play in the field
Papa smokes the pipe of a sweet and better life
But how strong is the shield?
Can peace be found on the carpet above ground
Where sky is forever blue

So let it pass baby now, the slow and riding cloud
Which may take me from you

Many things a man can lose
His self, his rights, his views
But never his heart or his love
So take this hand of mine and climb baby, climb
To the hill up above

Now you can play a queen on the hill built on a dream
While our children play in the field
I can smoke the pipe of a sweet and better life
And trust in the strength of the shield

So trust in you love, and Lucy of above
And let light pass like a wheel
Don't take the chance of life's hectic dance
Kiss the strength of the shield

The seeker will be found by the looker on the ground
And to his wish he will yield

Fate will have it's word, of course  
And time will change its course
And hold the strength of the shield
