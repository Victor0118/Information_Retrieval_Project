 back on the chain gang   ---the Pretenders      i found a picture of you, oh oh oh oh  what hijacked my world that night  to a place in the past  we've been cast out of? oh oh oh oh  now we're back in the fight  we're back on the train  oh, back on the chain gang      a circumstanbe beyond our control, oh oh oh oh  the phone, the tv and the news of the world  got in the house like a pigeon from hell, oh oh oh oh  threw sand in our eyes and descended like flies  put us back on the train  oh, back on the chain gang      the powers that be  that force us to live like we do  bring me to my knees  when i see what they've done to you  but i'll die as i stand here today  knowing that deep in my heart  they'll fall to ruin one day  for making us apart      i found a pibture of you, oh oh oh oh  those were the happiest days of my life  like a break in the battle was your part, oh oh oh oh  in the wretched life of a lonely heart  now we're back on the train  oh, back on the chain gang      the End
