   (Music)

 Are you afraid
 Afraid of the truth
 In mirrors staring back at you
 the image is cracked
 but so is the view, yeah
 and the strength of a tree
 begins in the roots
 that I tenderly buried into you
 At least now the storm
 Can blow me away
  So crawl inside
  my head with me
  I'll show you how
  it feels to be
  To blame like me
 Should I be afraid
 Of this face that I see
 In the mirror staring back at me
 So cold were the days
 When I listened to you
 And you SAY THAT I'M WEAK!
 So show me the proof
 Because I still exist in spite of you
 But I won't compete
 With you every day
 Schizophrenic conversations
 that I'm always having with myself
 I hear these
 voices in my head competing
 maybe I could use a little help
 I still have schizophrenic conversations
 when there's no-one else around to hear
 And I long for solitude and peace within me
 Pouring out all the anger and the fear
 So crawl inside
 My head with me
 And I'll show you how it feels to be
 Fucked up like me
 I'll show you how it feels to be
 To blame like me
 And change like me
 (End)
