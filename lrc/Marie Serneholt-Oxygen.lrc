 You touch my skin
 Change the mood I'm in
 Teach me how to fly
 Just by looking in my eyes
 Every word you say
 Sets my heart on fire
 Every move you make
 Takes me higher
   I get so high up here
   When I touch the sky
       It hurts me when I breathe
           I need oxygen
    Whenever you are near
    I can hardly speak
   I need
 Suddenly
 Suddenly I see
 How great my life can be
 Sailing in the wind
  With you my love
 Every day is brighter
 Everyday is brighter
 When I breathe
 I breathless
 It's mean need safe mass
