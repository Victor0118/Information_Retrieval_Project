 Written:Fred Karlin&Robb Wilson&Arthur James
       
  Love, look at the two of us
  Strangers in many ways
 We've got a lifetime to share
 So much to say
 And as we go
 From day to day
 I'll feel you close to me
 But time alone will tell
  Let's take a lifetime to say
  "I knew you well"
  For only time will tell us so
  And love may grow
 For all we know.
 For all we know. 
 The End
