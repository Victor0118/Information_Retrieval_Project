 It's at times such as this she'd be tempted to spit
 If she wasn't so ladylike
 She imagines how she might have lived
 back when legends and history collide
 So she looks to her prince finding he's so charmingly
 slumped at her side
 Those days are recalled on the gallery wall
 And she's waiting for passion or humour to strike
 
   What shall we do, what shall we do with all this useless beauty?
   All this useless beauty
 
 Good Friday arrived, the sky darkened on time
 'Til he almost began to negotiate
 She held his head like a baby and said "It's okay if you cry"
 Now he wants her to dress as if you couldn't guess
 He desires to impress his associates
 But he's part ugly beast and Hellenic deceased
 So she finds that the mixture is hard to deny
 
 (player saying)
 
 She won't practice the looks from the great tragic books
 That were later disgraced to face celluloid
 It won't even make sense but you can bet
 If she isn't a sweetheart or plaything or pet
 The film turns her into an unveiled threat
 
 Nonsense prevails, modesty fails
 Grace and virtue turn into stupidity
 While the calendar fades almost all barricades to a pale compromise
 And our leaders have feasts on the backsides of beasts
 They still think they're the gods of antiquity
 If something you missed didn't even exist
 It was just an ideal -- is it such a surprise?
 THE END
