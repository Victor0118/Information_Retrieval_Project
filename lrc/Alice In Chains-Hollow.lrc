      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Alice In Chains - Hollow . Turning in circles, slowing down Pulling against a closing out Easy to feed off a weaker thing Harder to say what I really mean . Hollow as a mountain All tunneled and drilled below Hollow as a mountain Crowned with a cold blue sky .

Hollow as a mountain All tunneled and drilled below Hollow as a mountain Crowned with a cold Hollow as a mountain All tunneled and drilled below Hollow as a mountain Crowned with a cold blue sky . Silence so loud, silence I can't tell my up from down Silence so loud, silence I can't tell my up from down . All of the faces life can show Withered and ugly the one you know . Hollow as a mountain All tunneled and drilled below Hollow as a mountain Crowned with a cold, blue sky . Silence so loud, silence I can't tell my up from down Silence so loud, silence I can't tell my up from down . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
