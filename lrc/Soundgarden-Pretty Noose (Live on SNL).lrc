 I caught the moon today
  Pick it up
 And throw it away all right
 I got the perfect steal
 A cleaner love
 With a dirty feel all right
 Fallout and take the bait
 Eat the fruit
 And kiss the snake goodnight
 Common ruse dirty face
 Pretty noose is pretty hate
  And I don't like
  What you got me hanging from
 Let your motor race
 And get this mother gone
 Out from and far away
 The wooden stake
 This thing has got me on
 Diamond rope silver chain
 Pretty noose is pretty pain
 I don't care what you got
 I don't care what you need
 I don't want anything
 And I don't like what 
 You got me hanging from
