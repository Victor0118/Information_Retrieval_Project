  Walk out into velvet
  Nothing more to say
  You're my favourite moment
  You're my Saturday

    Cos you're my Number 1
    I'm like a dog to get you
    I want it up and on
    I'm like a dog to get you
    
 Sunset only seconds
 Just ripe then it's gone
 Got no new intentions
 Just right then it's gone

 I'll be there to meet you
 Getting down to greet you

    Howl under the moon
