 frente  harm  shape  first time on earth  going to have to tell you how to laugh  smile like a star  a young disaster  you fist fight yourself like  look for the thread  try to keep the gloves above your head  time tied them tight  you cant pick things up  sit beside watch while  todays too much for you...  you just want to go, dont you?  youre damned if you dont and youre dumb if you do  knock knock shoot the clock  slip into a sleep full of sweat  think you closed your eyes  see the water rise  swim like a child might  swear at the sun  fumble your words like a gun  youre rusting in the street  and you try to trust your feet to find you  someone un numb  todays too much for you...  you just want to go, dont you?  aching in my arms,  youve come to harm  youve come to harm,   youve come to harm  die before you disregard the logic in your veins  you say the word again, you hear the word again, do you hate the word again?  step into my room  1000 of you  1000 of you  nobody cries  you slip out of your lies  flick (night) light dies  all of your cells yell surprise  death had beautiful eyes  death had beautiful eyes  soul in a spoon,  heart in a jar,  thats what you are  soul in a spoon,  youre coming down soon,  thats what you are  thats what you are,  thats what you are  thats what you are,  thats what you are
