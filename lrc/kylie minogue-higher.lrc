     higher kylie minogue 歌词编辑：听雨 QQ：850454409 Now I know how to get down on the floor Experience the moves you can't ignore But something 'bout this beat that's got me hooked Come over here and take a closer look   'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough I can't stay on the ground Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough This is taking me now   It's taking me higher, higher Higher off the ground It's taking me higher, higher Higher off the ground   I do this just for kicks, just for the thrill I got this high without taking a pill This move has got me way over the sun I'm dancing like I am the only one   'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough I can't stay on the ground Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough This is taking me now   It's taking me higher, higher Higher off the ground It's taking me higher, higher Higher off the ground   The music's got me going higher I feel like I can touch the sky   It's taking me higher, higher Higher off the ground It's taking me higher, higher Higher off the ground   It's taking me higher, higher Higher off the ground It's taking me higher, higher Higher off the ground lyric by rain
