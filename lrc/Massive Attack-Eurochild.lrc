 (vowles, del naja, marshall, thaws, norfolk, locke)
 
3D
 Sitting in my day care, the art is decopainted
 Blessed by the drink
 Upon the corner's where we've seen it
 Chased by the plaintiff
 Haunted by the medium
 Too high to flow toward to break the tedium
 Glow from my tv set was blue like neon
 Activated the remote I put the BBC on
 I've seen this city somewhere
 I'm looking out for no-one
 Pallor in my eye it get blue like neon

Tricky
 Hell is round the corner where i shelter
 Isms and schisms we're living on a skelter
 If you believe i'll deceive then common sense says shall you receive
 Let me take you down the corridors of my life
 And when you walk, do you walk to your preference
 No need to answer till i take further evidence
 I seem to need a reference to get residence
 A reference to your preference to say i'm a good neighbour
 I trudge so judge me for my labour
 
 I walk in a bar and immediately I sense danger
 You look at me, girl, as if i was some kind of a
 A total stranger

3D
 Hysterical, ecstatical no matter, call me stags(?)
 Hard to get a drink or a girl to relax
 Upon phono, no go zone i go through
 Aching awaits just to relocate you
 Kill us with your fist 
 Now baby mix it with me
 You see me function better when i get approximately
 High by my technical flyby
 I function better with the sun in my eyes
 So goodbye
 
Tricky
 Take a second of me you beckon i'll be
 And when you're sad i'll mourn
 And when you tear i'm torn
 Take a second of me
 Take a second of me
 I stand firm for our soil
 I lick a rock off foil
 So reduce me, seduce me
 Dress me up in Stüssy.
 Show me and i'll stick em
 Will you be my victim
 Take a second of me
 
3D
 Mad over you, mad over me, an analogy
 Baby tagging up up all of my stationary
 Sitting in my daycare, media dego painted
 Colliding with the jam
 Until the drink got dated
 Window indigo when they go boom
 I run inside my room
 No sense you can trust me
 Climb on my sofa
 Roll in a daydream
 Spliff make daddy go sleep-a-trip dream
 
 
 END
