You are my reason to live All I own I would give 

Just to have you adore me 

Till the moon deserts the sky 

Till the all the seas run dry 

Till then I'll worship you 

Till the tropic sun turns cold 

Till this young world grows old 

My darling, I'll adore you 

You are my reason to live All I own I would give 

Just to have you adore me 

Till the rivers flow upstream 

Till lovers cease to dream 

Till then I'm yours, be mine
