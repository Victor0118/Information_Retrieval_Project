 I set out on a narrow way many years ago
 Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
 But I got lost a time or two
 Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
 I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you
 
 Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
 Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
 Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
 This much I know is true
 That God blessed the broken road
 That led me straight to you
 
 I think about the years I spent just passing through
 I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
 But you just smile and take my hand
 You've been there you understand
 It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true
 
 Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
 Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
 Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
 This much I know is true
 That God blessed the broken road
 That led me straight to you
 
 Now I'm just rolling home
 Into my lover's arms
 This much I know is true
 That God blessed the broken road
 That led me straight to you.
 That God blessed the broken road
 That led me straight to you.
