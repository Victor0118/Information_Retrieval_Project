 Sharp as teeth and stars
 I can't give you up
 Like a moth to light
 Move like caramel
  Til dawn
  You glow
  
    Soon be nothing of this world
    Soon be nothing
  
 Breathe back into life
 Stabs at happiness
 Now we're having fun
  Hold tight, don't look down
   Til dawn
   You glow
