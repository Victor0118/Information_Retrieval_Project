 Gwen Stefani - Cool 
    by:miau
 
 It's hard to remember how it felt before
 Now I found the love of my life...
 Passes things get more comfortable
 Everything is going right
 
 And after all the obstacles
 It's good to see you now with someone else
 And it's such a miracle
  that you and me are still good friends
 After all that we've been through
 I know we're cool
 
 I know we're cool
 
 We used to think it was impossible
 Now you call me by my new last name
 Memories seem like so long ago
 Time always kills the pain
 
 Remember Harbor Boulevard
 The dreaming days where the mess was made
 Look how all the kids have grown
 We have changed but we're still the same
 After all that we've been through
 I know we're cool 
 
 I know we're cool
 
 I know we're cool
 
 And I'll be happy for you
 If you can be happy for me
 Circles and triangles, 
 and now we're hangin' out with your new
 girlfriend
 So far from where we've been
 I know we're cool
 I know we're cool
 co..cool
 I know we're cool
 I know we're cool
 co..cool
 I know we're cool
