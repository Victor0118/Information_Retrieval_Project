Ah, get behind me Satan
Quit ravishing the land
Does it take the children
To make you understand?

Ah, all across the nation
People don't understand
Does it take the children
To make a better land?

Then, get behind me Satan
Quit ravishing the land

Does it take the children
To make you understand?
Does it take the children
To make a better land?
