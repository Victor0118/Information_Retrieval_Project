     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Break the Ice (Jason Nevins Rock - Britney Spears I know it's been a while But I'm glad you came And I've been thinking 'bout How you said my name Got my body spinning Like a hurricane And it feels like You got me going insane And I can't get enough So let me get it up Ooh looks like we're alone now You ain't gotta be scared We're grown now I'm a hit defrost on ya Let's get it blazin' We can turn the heat up if you wanna Turn the lights down low if you wanna Just wanna move you But you're froze up That's what I'm saying Let me break the ice Allow me to get you right Won't you warm up to me Baby I can make you feel  Let me break the ice Allow me to get you right Won't you warm up to me Baby I can make you feel  So you warming up yet  You got me hypnotized  I never felt this way You got my heart beating Like an 808 Can you rise To the occasion I'm patiently waiting because It's getting late And I can't get enough So let me get it up Ooh looks like we're alone now You ain't gotta be scared We're grown now I'm a hit defrost on ya Let's get it blazin' We can turn the heat up if you wanna Turn the lights down low if you wanna Just wanna move you But you're froze up That's what I'm saying Let me break the ice Allow me to get you right Won't you warm up to me Baby I can make you feel  Let me break the ice Allow me to get you right Won't you warm up to me Baby I can make you feel  I like this part  Feels kinda good  Yeah  Let me break the ice Allow me to get you right Won't you warm up to me Baby I can make you feel Let me break the ice Allow me to get you right Won't you warm up to me Baby I can make you feel Hot Let me break the ice Allow me to get you right Won't you warm up to me Baby I can make you feel  Let me break the ice Allow me to get you right Won't you warm up to me Baby I can make you feel  陈先生 QQ：1552195557
