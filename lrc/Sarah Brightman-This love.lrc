 This Love
     
        This love
 This love is a strange love
 A faded kind of day love
 I think I'm gonna fall again
 And even when you held my hand
 It didn't mean a thing
 Never has to say love
 Doesn't know it is love
 Doesn't have to say love
 Doesn't need to be love
 Doesn't mean a thing
 This love, oh-oh-oh ...
 This strange love (strange love)
 This love...
