I'm sure it is bright
but you left so early that morning

It's known for it's light
It's not very far
Come back to me
For the moonlight

It's so dangerous here
Love takes my time
Love makes me worry

But it ain't so far
to where you are
We still can meet

In the moonlight
In the moonlight
