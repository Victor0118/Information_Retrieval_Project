 My wrists stay rocked up 
 My TV's pop up in a Maybach benz 
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 Nigga you can't see me 
 My bently GT got smoke gray tints 
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man 
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya mans 
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 
   
 Seven series BM, Six series benz 
 Twenty-four inches, Gio ni rims 
 All on one wheel when I'm on one of them 
 Ma, that boy out there actin a fool that's him 
 They say I've changed man, I'm getting paper, I'm flashy 
 They like me better when I'm fucked up and ashy 
 My royalty check's the rebirth of Liberace 
 Stunt so hard, everybody got to watch me 
 And I don't really care if it's platinum or white gold 
 As long as the VS bling, look at that light show 
 In the hood they say Fifty man your sneaker look white yo 
 Just can't believe Reebok did a deal with a psycho 
 Banks is a sure thing, yall niggaz might blow 
 I'm fittin to drop that, so I suggest you lay low 
 Buc, he from Cashville, Tenneckee nigga 
 Getting them ten of keys, save ten for me nigga 
 
   
   
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 My wrists stay rocked up 
 My TV's pop up in a Maybach benz 
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 Nigga you can't see me 
 My bently GT got smoke gray tints 
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man 
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya mans 
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 
   
 I'm sensing a lot of tension now that I'm rappin 
 But the kids used to look up to you, what happened? 
 Me on the corner, (????), hand covered with platinum 
 Different color coupes but I'm in love with the black one 
 On point, cuz you get R.I.P.'s when slacking 
 So the stashbox big enough to squeeze the mack in 
 Yeah, I'm fairly new but I demand some respect 
 Cuz I already wear your ad ce on my neck 
 I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches 
 Blue yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers 
 I already figured out what to do with all my features 
 Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers 
 When it comes to stuntin' theres nothing you can teach us 
 We're in a different time zone, your records don't reach us 
 Naww, I ain't here to save the world, just roll up a blunt 
 Come with me out front, I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO STUNT 
 
   
   
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 My wrists stay rocked up 
 My TV's pop up in a Maybach benz 
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 Nigga you can't see me 
 My bently GT got smoke gray tints 
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man 
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya mans 
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 
   
 Chain so icy, you don't have to like me 
 In a throwback jersey, with the throwback nikes 
 I know you probably seen me with Cash Money from back in the days 
 The only thing changed is the numbers on the range 
 I bought me an old school and blew out the brains 
 The Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain 
 My sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing 
 And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game 
 Come on now, we all know gold is getting old 
 The ice in my teeth keep the crystal cold 
 G-Unit homie, actin' like yall don't know 
 Look, I can't even walk through the mall no more 
 I just pull up, get out, and get all the hoes 
 They never seen doors lift up on a car before 
 Don't be mad at me dog, that's all I know 
 That's how to show these fougaisies how it's supposed to go 
 
   
   
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 My wrists stay rocked up 
 My TV's pop up in a Maybach benz 
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 Nigga you can't see me 
 My bently GT got smoke gray tints 
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man 
 I'll teach you how to stunt 
 I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya mans 
 I'll teach you how to stunt
