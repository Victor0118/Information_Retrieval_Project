 young love
 write:蒋大洋
 They say for every boy and girl
 There's just one love in this whole world
 And I know I've found mine
 The heavenly touch of your embrace
 Tells me no one could take your place
 Ever in my heart
 Young love (young love),
 first love (first love)
 Filled with true devotion
 Young love (young love), 
 our love (our love)
 We share with deep emotion
 music
 Just one kiss from your sweet lips
 Will tell me that your love is real
 And I can feel that it's true
 We will vow to one another
 There will never be another
 Love for you or for me
 Young love (young love), first love (first love)
 Filled with true devotion
 Young love (young love), our love (first love)
 We share with deep emotion
 music
