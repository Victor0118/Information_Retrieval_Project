 In the name of 
 And by the power of 
 The holy spirit 
 May we invoke your 
 Intercession for 
 The children of england 
 Some of whom have seen 
 Murder so obscene
 Some of whom have been taken 
 Let not another child be slain 
 Let not another search be made in vain 
 
 Jah forgive us 
 For forgetting 
 Jah help us 
 We need more loving 
 See the teachers
 Are representing you 
 So badly
 That not many can see you
 Let not another child be slain 
 Let not another search be made in vain 
 
 Jah calls the ones who's 
 Beliefs kill children to 
 Feel the love of you and be healed 
 And may we all cry too 
 For representing you 
 So badly so badly 
 Jah forgive us 
 For forgetting 
 Oh Jah help us 
 To be forgiving
 The teachers are representing you 
 So badly that not many can see you
 Let not another search be made in vain
 Let not another child be slain 
 
 
 END
