  A foggy day in London Town
  I had me low and had me down
  I viewed the morning with such alarm
  The British Museum had lost its charm
 
  How long, I wondered, could this thing last?
  But the age of miracles hadn't passed,
  For, suddenly, I saw you there
  And through foggy London Town
  The sun was shining everywhere.
  
 THE END
