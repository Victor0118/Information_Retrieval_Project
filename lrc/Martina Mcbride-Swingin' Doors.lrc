      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Martina McBride – Swingin' Doors . You have worn a path Right up to my heart You come in for a while but you don't stay And I've come to realize That your promises are lies To buy you time when you want to get away . You must think my heart has swingin' doors The way that you keep comin' back and forth I can feel it's getting close to closing time And I won't be leavin' my heart open any more .  Well, I've heard you're back in town I suppose you'll come around When nights are cold and friends are hard to find You always seem to wait 'Til all the pieces are in place Then you walk back in and rearrange my life . You must think my heart has swingin' doors The way that you keep comin' back and forth I can feel it's getting close to closing time And I won't be leavin' my heart open any more . So if you're walking down my street just keep on walking by I'm hangin' out a sign sayin' this well has run dry . You must think my heart has swingin' doors The way that you keep comin' back and forth I can feel it's getting close to closing time And I won't be leavin' my heart open any more . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
