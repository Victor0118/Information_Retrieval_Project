Things just ai not bad as they seem With you in mind I can fill my widest dreams With you in mind I can do anthing,I know I can With you in mind ,with you in mind With you in mind I went out looking for the best With you in mind Couse you deserve nothing less With you in mind I have done so many things That love can bring With you in mind ,with you in mind Like a flower...flower Drinking from the falling rain Though the same rain That could wash it away Gives it strength...strength Gives it...oh love And before you know,another day
