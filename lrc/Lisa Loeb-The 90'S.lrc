      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Lisa Loeb - The 90's . Betsy cut my dress a little shorter Get me ready for my video One take I'll shake it up on MTV All eyes on me John make my platforms a little higher I gotta walk without my band All eyes on me They say I'm folk but I like Bowie . Whoaaaa Those were the 90's Whoaaaa And times flies so fast Whoaaaa You say you love me then But I don't wanna go back . We let our hair grow long Got biker boots and wrote tough songs So I'm the angel She's the demon All the words have too much meaning . Whoaaaa Those were the 90's Whoaaaa And times flies so fast Whoaaaa You say you love me then But I don't wanna go back No, I don't wanna go back . He can't spit out what he thinks Waits to hear and then agrees Still sends me a limousine So alternative just like everyone else in the mainstream .   . No, I don't wanna go wanna go back Whoaaaa Those were the 90's Whoaaaa And times flies so fast Whoaaaa You say you love me then But I don't wanna go back  No, I don't wanna go back . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
