All you folks think you own my life 
But you never made any sacrifice 
Demons they are on my trail 
I'm standing at the crossroads of the hell 
I look to the left I look to the right 
There're hands that grab me on every side 


All you folks think I got my price 
At which I'll sell all that is mine 
You think money rules when all else fails 
Go sell your soul and keep your shell 
I'm trying to protect what I keep inside 
All the reasons why I live my life 



Some say the devil be a mystical thing 
I say the devil he a walking man 
He a fool he a liar conjurer and a thief 
He try to tell you what you want 
Try to tell you what you need 


Standing at the point 
The road it cross you down 
What is at your back 
Which way do you turn 
Who will come to find you first 
Your devils or your gods 


All you folks think you run my life 
Say I should be willing to comprimise 
I say all you demons go back to hell 
I'll save my soul save myself
