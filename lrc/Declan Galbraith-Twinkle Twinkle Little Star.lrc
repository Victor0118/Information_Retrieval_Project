 How I wonder what you are?
 Looking at your magic light
 Watching over us tonight
 Before my dreams take me away
 I kneel beside my bed and pray
 For all the children in the dark
 Till tomorrow, twinkle little star....
 Promise me you'll twinkle little star....
 Cos everybody needs a little star.
