 If this isn't what you see
 It doesn't make you blind
 If this doesn't make you feel
 It doesn't mean you've died
  Where the river's high
 If you don't want to be seen
 You don't have to hide
 If you don't want to believe
 You don't have to try
 To feel alive
   Alive in the superunknown
   First it steals your mind
  And then it steals your soul
 If this doesn't make you free
 It doesn't mean you're tied
 If this doesn't take you down
 It doesn't mean you're high
 If this doesn't make you smile
 You don't have to cry
 If this isn't making sense
 It doesn't make it lies
 Get yourself afraid
 Get yourself alone
 Get yourself contained
 Get yourself control
 And then it steals your... soul
