 Here I am again
 Back where I started from
 And just when I let myself fall deep
 Fall hard
 It seems every time I give my all
 I turn around only to get slapped in the face with rejection
 Now see this is the type of stuff that makes me just wanna
 STOP!!
 Just stop it all
 Stop the giving to avoid the taking
 Stop loving to avoid the hating
 Stop trusting to avoid all these lies
 But most of all
 Stop flying to avoid the fall
 
 END
