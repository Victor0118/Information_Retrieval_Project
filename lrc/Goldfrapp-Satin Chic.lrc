 You're so satin chic
 Look rich, talking cheap
 On your telephone
 Won't be coming home

   He's my man
   Yeah he's my man
   You don't understand
   
      Ne Na Na Na Na Na Na
      Ne Na Na Na Na Na Na
   
 Dressed up lizard green
 Celluloid seventeen
 Lip gloss bold as blood
 You got em linin' up

 Racing through the stars
 You killed me awhile
 My smile synchronized
 For every one tonight
