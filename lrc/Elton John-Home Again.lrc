     Home Again - Elton John  LRC by Mr.Lei QQ:395254794  I'm counting on a memory to get me out of here I'm waiting for the fog around this spooky little town to clear. All this time I spent being someone else's friend Just one more time, for old time sake I'd like to go back home again!  The world had seven wonders once upon a time It's sure enough the favorite nations aided their decline And all around me I've seen times like it was back when But like back then, I'd say, man, if I can go back home again!  If I could go back home, if I could go back home If I'd never left, I'd never have known! We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end Spending all our time trying to get back home again!  Could have been a jail break and a spot light hitting me Or was that just some night club singer, back in 1963. In the old part of Valencia, on the coast of Spain Never tiring once of hearing songs about going home again!  If I could go back home, if I could go back home If I'd never left, I'd never have known We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end Spending all our time trying to get back home again!  If I could go back home, if I could go back home If I'd never left, I'd never have known We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end Spending all our time trying to get back home again!  歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com
