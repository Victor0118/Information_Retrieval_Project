 Yeah, this one's dedicated, to my grandmother, and your grandmother
 It's all love, let's not forget who raised us, word up
 
 
 Big Mama, my grandmother, my main girl
 I love you much more than the scandalous world
 As a young boy you gave me whoopings to save my life
 Cursed me out, to keep me out the streets at night
 Cause my momma had me when she was young
 So you took on the responsbility to raise your grandson
 You taught me if a task is once begun, Todd
 Never leave it 'til it's done, Todd
 Be thy labor great or small Todd
 Do it well or not at all, God
 Big Mama, my blood is your blood
 When the whole world's against me, I know I got your love
 If I was in a cell for the rest of my life
 I know I'd hear your prayers in the middle of the night
 Used to sit me on your lap and teach me mother wit
 Early Sunday morning for them salmon and grits
 I love you baby, you the one and only, that's a fact
 'Til death do us part, I'ma always have your back
 You beefed cause you heard that I was cursin in my raps
 Eighty-six, still you wanna run and get the straps
 I love you, I promise you I care for you deep
 Cause when I had bronchitis you would rock me to sleep
 Rub me down with green alcohol
 Little brown-skinned lady bout five feet tall, Big Mama

[Chorus: Dru Hill + (LL)]
 Early one Sunday morning
 Breakfast was on the table (you gave me unconditional love)
 There was no time to eat, she said to me
 Boy hurry to Sunday school (you gave me unconditional love)

 
 I remember when you told me certain friends wasn't real
 I didn't wanna listen, I swore I knew the deal
 Come to find out, everything you said was true
 Who I end up goin to for advice? You
 I love you, that's why you got nurses and maids
 Ever since I got paid, you ain't never been afraid
 That's granddaddy wife, she taught me how to think
 How to navigate through life, you made the sacrifice
 You kept on livin, cause when my granddaddy died
 It took all your might, but you ain't quit on life
 We took trips down South, biscuits and chicken
 Me you granddad and Alison, trippin
 Remember, you used to pick me up from junior high
 And classmates laughed when the Buick rolled by
 Remember, I pulled my privates out in class
 And from Farmers to Dunkirk you straight whooped my (woo!!)
 The best cookin a man could ever taste
 It's written in my heart, it can never be erased
 Thank you so much, you taught me well
 How to not get souped up, because I'm LL
 How to walk the street, and hold my head real high
 How to live with Christ and not be afraid to die
 We sipped daquiris, but you never told moms
 We even shared beers, Big Mama my dear
 A toast to a woman that raised a man
 In popular demand all across the land
 You're my lawyer, my teacher, my doctor, my friend
 My mother, my father, you with me 'til the end
 I love you, I mean that from the bottom of my heart
 That's the reason why my record's #1 on the charts
 I'ma tell it like it is, I love you forever
 Dead or alive, we'll always be together
 Big Mama I love you

 
 Early one Sunday morning
 Breakfast was on the table (you gave me unconditional love)
 There was no time to eat, she said to me
 Boy hurry to Sunday school (you gave me unconditional love)

 
 I dedicate this to the Big Mama's everywhere
 The ones who raised us - when nobody else was there
 The ones who held us and told us it'll be alright
 When gunshots was goin off every night
 Taught us how to lock the door and check the peephole
 And how to swallow Vicks when we had a chest cold
 How to stay proud, and represent hard
 Eat plenty baby, but first say grace for God
 Big Mama, I'ma miss you
 When one of us leave this earth
 But baby for what it's worth, I love you since the date of my birth
 And if it wasn't for my children, I would wanna go first
 You're the reason I'm the man I am today
 The inspiration, for me to be LL Cool J
 When you told me "Knock 'Em Out," I brought you home a Grammy
 I learned to be tough from Big Mama and Aunt Cammy
 A black man that was raised by black women
 On tour, sippin your special honey and lemon
 You told me, gargle with vinegar water and salt
 The concert was hot, thanks to your support
 Girl - you're the one I love
 Whether right here with me or smilin from up above
 Trouble or no trouble, you always had my back
 So I had to let you know your son appreciates that, Big Mama

 
  Early one Sunday morning
  Breakfast was on the table (you gave me unconditional love)
  There was no time to eat, she said to me
  Boy hurry to Sunday school (you gave me unconditional love)
 
 
 END
