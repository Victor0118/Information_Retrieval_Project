      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Lisa Loeb  - He Loved You So Much . Cool, wearing corduroy there's that horrible feeling that nothing feeling . You had your moments, but seemed kind of standoffish and kept stepping off the sidewalk on the way out of your office you were always there, you were always there . He wanted to walk next to you I'm not sure you ever wanted to meet him on time but you did say you'd mind it, getting recognized . But he loved you so much he stayed by your side he loved you so much he would never leave you he loved you so much, he was scared to tell you. . He was the one who'd really lived, honestly and you were the one who drove dangerously at night not like cowboys and shootouts, but distracted by the cigarette light . It was you who wanted to leave his sweet, sweet eyes you tried, seemed like you tried but not hard enough no, not hard enough . But he loved you so much he stayed by your side he loved you so much he would never leave you he love you so much, he was scared to tell you. .  Together, here on Earth "it's nothing special," you said but why on Earth would he look interested but try to get it over with? . But he loved you so much he stayed by your side he loved you so much he would never leave you he would never leave you he was scared to tell you. . But he loved you so much he stayed by your side he loved you so much he would never leave you he loved you so much, he was scared to tell you. . Cool I had a feeling a bad, bad feeling . It was never as cold as it is now, you said he used to offer you his jacket but you can't take it anymore
