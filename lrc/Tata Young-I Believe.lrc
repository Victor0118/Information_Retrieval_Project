 I feel the heat around me
 I feel the beat surrounds me
 Could this be for real, I wonder
 No need for hesitation
 It’s time for celebration
 Will this be the night I’ve waited for
 When angels fall in love
 Heaven knows, does it show, oh
 If this love, will last for eternity
 Set me on fire

     I believe, I believe in love
    And like the stars above
    They shine, let it shine over me
    Set me free I believe in you
    And that our love is true
     Oh I believe, I believe

 I see that people dancing
 Boys and girls romancing
 They want this to last forever
 Cause underneath the moonlight
 Everything is alright
 We’re reaching our hands up in the air
 To where the souls alive
 Heaven knows, that it shows oh
 If this love, will last for eternity
 Set me on fire

 How could I doubt, what was meant to be
 Everything I needed was in front of me
 Your healing touch, will lift me up in the sky, so high
