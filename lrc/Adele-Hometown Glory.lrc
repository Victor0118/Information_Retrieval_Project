     Hometown Glory - Adele  LRC By 潇风寒月 QQ：395254794  I've been walking in the same way as I did Missing out the cracks in the pavement And tutting my heel and strutting my feet “Is there anything I can do for you dear? Is there anyone I could call?” “No and thank you' please Madam. I ain't lost' just wandering”  Round my hometown Memories are fresh Round my hometown Ooh the people I've met Are the wonders of my world Are the wonders of my world Are the wonders of this world Are the wonders of my world I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque I love to see everybody in short skirts' shorts and shades I like it in the city when two worlds collide You get the people and the government Everybody taking different sides Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit Shows that we are united Shows that we ain't gonna take it Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit Shows that we are united Round my hometown Memories are fresh Round my hometown Ooh the people I've met  Are the wonders of my world Are the wonders of my world Are the wonders of this world Are the wonders of my world....  歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com
