 Do I stress you out
 My sweater is on backwards and inside out
 And you say how appropriate
 I don't want to dissect everything today
 I don't mean to pick you apart you see
 But I can't help it
 
 There I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off
 Slap me with a splintered ruler
 And it would knock me to the floor
 if I wasn't there already
 If only I could hunt the hunter
 
 And all I really want is some patience
 A way to calm the angry voice
 And all I really want is deliverance
 Do I wear you out
 You must wonder why
 I'm so relentless and all strung out
 I'm consumed by the chill of solitary
 I'm like Estella
 I like to reel it in and then spit it out
 I'm frustrated by your apathy
 
 And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land
 If only I could meet the Maker
 And I am fascinated by the spiritual man
 I am humbled by his humble nature
 What I wouldn't give to find a soulmate
 Someone else to catch this drift
 And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred
 
 Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minute
 Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while
 The conflicts, the craziness
 and the sound of pretenses
 Falling all around...all around
 
 Why are you so petrified of silence
 Here can you handle this?
 
 Did you think about your bills,
 your ex, your deadlines
 Or when you think you're gonna die
 Or did you long for the next distraction
 
 And all I need know is intellectual intercourse
 A soul to dig the hole much deeper
 And I have no concept of time other than it is flying
 If only I could kill the killer
 
 All I really want is some peace man
 a place to find a common ground
 And all I really want is a wavelength
 All I really want is some comfort
 A way to get my hands untied
 And all I really want is some justice...
