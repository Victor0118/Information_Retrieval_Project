      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Shine My Shoes - Robbie Williams . Another dawn, another day Another another dollar to be made I got a pocket in my soul where a little rock a little roll assimilate . and i don’t care what you think you know ‘bout who I am and how it goes I made it easy to be me so it’s easy to me be and that’s why I say: . I know you can’t stand me cos’ I make you so angry more and more each day .  the way you don’t love me kinda makes you look ugly and the words you say . come up and see me, oh oh oh I kinda like the abuse there is no room in my bed but while you’re here just bow your head and you could shine my shoes shine my shoes . get out of my lane boy you’re not in my league some are born to thrive and some to underachive . here is something that’ll make you sick I’m as happy as a pig and sh(it). I’ve been amused, I’ve been admired, I’ve been amazed, I’ve been betrayed and that’s why I say: . I know you can’t stand me cos I make you so angry more and more each day . the way you don’t love me kinda makes you look ugly and the words you say . come up and see me, oh oh oh if you can take the abuse there is no room in my bed but while you’re here then lend an hand and you can shine my shoes Shine my shoes You’re done, boy . That’s why you can’t stand me I make you so angry more and more each day . the way you don’t love me kinda makes you look ugly every word you say . come up and see me, oh oh oh I kinda like the abuse  there is no room in my bed but while you’re here then bow your head and you can shine my shoes Shine my shoes  Until I see my face . 歌词编辑：活在當下     QQ：6313827
