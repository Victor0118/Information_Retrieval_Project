 C'mon now let me feel the gross out ain't corruptin' you
 Alone and trippin' out on acid agein' in your room
 I feel so down
 Time bring me round
 
 C'mon now let me feel the gross out obvious and aloof
 I know ya never had a faith in all that which ya knew
 I feel so down
 Time bring me round
 
 C'mon now let me feel the gross out
 C'mon I'll let ya feel the gross out
