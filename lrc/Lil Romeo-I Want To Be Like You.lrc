Chorus: Lil' Romeo, repeat 2x]
I wish I was tall like you 
I wish I could ball like you, like you
You know i like to walk like you, like you
Thats why I talk like you, like you whoody whooo

 
When I grow up i wanta be just like you
Eat drink sleep whatever, just like you
Finish school cause bein a fool ain't cool
When I walk past them same corners just like you
I got hopes and dreams
By the time I'm thirteen I wanta tote around the whole world
Know what I mean?
I play ball like you used to crawl like you
I had 36 the other day, I even score like you, walk like you, talk you
Everything I do my friends say remind me of you
Its you, who made me act like I do 
It was you who told me what I could and couldn't do
Never told me no, just advised me of what to do
Kept me bouncin balls as I recall the age of two, shootin freethrows 
Okay I made a few
Dad where you at? I need you in the booth

 

 
Its a family thing, so I got your back
I mean we teammates son like Kobe and Shaq
And when your momma tell you somethin I mean listen to her whodi 
Respect your elders that what your granpa told me
I mean times have change we growin up together
The first father and son to rap and blow up together
Blood is thicker than water
I know you tougher than leather
But I be on you cause I want you to do better
I done been on these streets, I done lived that life
I mean why do wrong and you can do right
Say no to drugs
Education goes far
You can be a doctor lawyer politician or star
You wanta be like me son then make me proud
And when you get that diploma don't forget to smile

 

 
Yo pops you tha one

 
Yo son you tha one
I love you son

 
I love you pops

 
Cause when its all said and done, we all we got
But we won't stop, we won't stop, This No Limit Family we won't stop
