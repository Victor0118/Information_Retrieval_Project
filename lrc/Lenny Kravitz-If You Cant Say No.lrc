 This is a part for you
 If you come undone
 Then this is what you do
 If you can’t say no just think about
 If you can’t say no just think about
 If you can’t say no just think about me
 If you can’t say no just think about
 If you can’t say no just think about
 If you can’t say no just think about me
 
 I know that you are in love with me
 But I also know your kind
 Baby you got a lot of nerve
 So just try to keep me in mind
 
 If you can’t say no just think about
 If you can’t say no just think about
 If you can’t say no just think about me
 If you can’t say no just think about
 If you can’t say no just think about
 If you can’t say no just think about me
 
  You went with another man
  And I cried when I read your letter
  But I don’t really want to know
  Where you’ve gone
  Or if it was better
  
    If you can’t say no just think about
    If you can’t say no just think about
    If you can’t say no just think about me
    If you can’t say no just think about
   If you can’t say no just think about
   If you can’t say no just think about me
