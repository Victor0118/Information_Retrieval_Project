     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Backstreet Boys - Try  I know that you're hurting now  Seems like it just no way out Feels like it's all gone wrong You keep on sippin' till you can't hold on Dont warry I'm right by your side My shoulder is yours if you need to cry There is times when love is just too much I know you want too but don't give up  Try baby try Give me a moment of your time No, no don't close your eyes I know you're hurting now We can work it out If we just try If we just try  It's always been just me and you You know I've been down there too Always when I needed you you were strong Let me hold you baby when hope is gone  Try baby try Give me a moment of your time No, no don't, don't, don't close your eyes I know you're hurting now We can work it out If we just try Try  Holding on, holding on We used to know how to Oooooooh When the nights are so long Sing your favourite song  If we just try baby try Give me a moment of your time No, no don't, don't, don't close your eyes I know you're hurting now We can work it out If we just try We can try  Splendidyang
