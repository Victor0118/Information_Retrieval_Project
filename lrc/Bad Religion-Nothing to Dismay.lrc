      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Bad Religion - Nothing To Dismay . Now, there's a list of catalysts that hold the heart at bay They grip the mind and sap the soul and feed on your dismay And I never understood why you can't see the world this way The lines are drawn at the break of dawn there's nothing to dismay . It's no, no, no security No, no, no security No, no, no security Nothing to dismay It's no, no, no security No, no, no security No, no, no security Nothing to dismay . The dissonance runs deep in me resort to weak applause Associate and denigrate the root without a cause And just because the overwhelming odds are stacked away What good is should if at most I would? But nothing to dismay . It's no, no, no security No, no, no security No, no, no security Nothing to dismay It's no, no, no security No, no, no security No, no, no security Nothing to dismay . Well, it's just a solo journey Bewildered and astray But pay no mind to what you find There's nothing to dismay . It's no, no No, no No, no Nothing to dismay . It's no, no, no security No, no, no security No, no, no security Nothing to dismay It's no, no, no security No, no, no security No, no, no security Nothing to dismay . It's nothing Nothing to dismay . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
