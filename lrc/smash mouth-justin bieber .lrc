     justin bieber  smash mouth 歌词编辑：听雨 QQ：850454409 Whoa oh, oh oh oh oh   Whatever happened to Justin Bieber  Was he all that or was he left behind  Did Keith stay with Nikki or did he leave her  Just a little something that's been on my mind   Whatever happened to hi top sneakers  Do you have yours just like I still have mine  Or did they go out of style baby just like streakers  Was it all for real or were we caught in time   Oh oh, where did everybody go?  In another 10 years or so  When it's after the show  Would you buy another ticket  Or just let me go  Whoa oh, oh oh oh oh  Whoa oh, oh oh oh oh   Did we have enough of all the Facebook Twetters?  Did we really have to hear about it all the time?  Whatever happened to the die hard Gleekers  They covered everything except a song of mine   Oh oh, where did everybody go?  In another 10 years or so  When it's after the show  Would you buy another ticket  Or just let me go  Whoa oh, oh oh oh oh  Whoa oh, oh oh oh oh  Whoa oh, oh oh oh oh  Whoa oh, oh oh oh oh   And the years just keep on flying  And I think we've lost control  Is anybody out there?  Does anybody know?  Whoa oh, oh oh oh oh  Whoa oh, oh oh oh oh   Oh oh, where did everybody go?  In another 10 years or so  When it's after the show  Would you buy another ticket  Or just let me go   Oh oh, where did everybody go?  In another 10 years or so  When it's after the show  Would you buy another ticket  Or just let me go  Whoa oh, oh oh oh oh  Whoa oh, oh oh oh oh lyric by rain
