     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Disasterpiece(Album Version) - Sugar Ray I just got hit by lightning again and she went right through me  Pick me up off my back replace my skin  Woman get your dirty mind out of my head, yeah I never knew how good, I never knew how good it could be All over the world she's that kind of girl There's one in every scene, do you know what I mean? She's got that kind of face you see in every place Another beautiful girl all over the world  Once again ask the Devil how he's been And my angel asked me, "Why do you always have to give in?"  So I told them, "You never know what day it is Until it's Saturday night" Get your dirty mind out of my head, yeah I never knew how good, I never knew how good it could be All over the world she's that kind of girl There's one in every scene, do you know what I mean? She's got that kind of face you see in every place Another beautiful girl all over the world  I finally got it right, she knew what I was thinking I always knew how good it could be  Stay tonight, stay tonight I always knew how good it could be Stay tonight, woman I always knew how good it could be All over the world she's that kind of girl There's one in every scene, do you know what I mean? She's got that kind of face you see in every place Another beautiful girl all over the world  All over the world  陈先生 QQ：1552195557
