 Everybody needs a reason to believe 
 Something to keep 'em going 
 To set their soul on fire 
 And make 'em feel alive 
 It's their inspiration 
   
   Some find it in living off the land 
   Some find it in working for the man 
   Some find it with a bottle in their hand 
   That's what gets 'em through 
   Some find it in a shiny limousine 
   Some find it in the magazines they read 
   Some find happiness is out of reach 
   No matter what they do 
   Baby, that's not me 
   I found it in you 
 
 I always wondered when 
 My search was gonna end 
 And I'd find what I'd been missin' 
 Now everything you are 
 It goes right to my heart 
 And it feeds this passion 
 
 You're my journey's end 
 My solid ground 
 You're what I could never live without
