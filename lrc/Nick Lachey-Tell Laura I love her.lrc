 Tell Laura I love her
 美国乡村音乐
 Laura and Tommy were lovers
 He wanted to give her everything
 Flowers, presents and most of all, a wedding ring
 He saw a sign for a stock car race
 A thousand dollar prize it read
 He couldn't get Laura on the phone
 So to her mother Tommy said
 Tell Laura I love her, tell Laura I need her
 Tell Laura I may be late
 I've something to do, that cannot wait
 He drove his car to the racing grounds
 He was the youngest driver there
 The crowed roared as they started the race
 'Round the track they drove at a deadly pace
 No one knows what happened that day
 How his car overturned in flames
 But as they pulled him from the twisted wreck
 With his dying breath, they heard him say
    Tell Laura I love her, tell Laura I need her
    Tell Laura not to cry
   My love for her will never die
 Now and in the chapel where Laura prays
 For Tommy who passed away
 It was just for Laura he lived and died
 Alone in the chapel she can hear him cry
 Tell Laura I love her, tell Laura I need her
 Tell Laura not to cry
 My love for her will never die
