 Akon  show out (show out) show out (show out)
 I'm sure that the streets are watching me
 Rather not run when the cops are stopping me
 Pulled over on the road they watching me
 As they walk passed all the chicks are jockin me
 Ferrari truck on the side of the road
 Raspberry paint gloss sitting on 24's
 Give me a warning ticket, letting me go
 Cause you can tell by the jewels that I ain't an average Joe
 Cause I meet fresh dimes daily
 You burn me really
 Cause I done seen your type before
 You wanna hate out on the chef cause he baking that dough, yo
 Don't tempt me cause I'm close to the edge
 I'm tryin not to lose my head
 Cause you don't really wanna see me show out(show out)
 In the club on free spinning G's(show out)
 Mocca humma 24's on these(show out)
 Yo playa don't make me(show out)
 Cause You don't really wanna see me(show out)
 Akon got a crew so deep(show out)
 From the West Indies to over seas(show out)
 Yo mammi don't make me(show out)
 It's all good but I'm still in the hood
 Like right around the corner cause its all in my brain
 A nice crib on the hill of Hollywood but the ghetto mind stayin
 Ain't a damn thing changed
 It's funny how people switch when they get rich
 Spend it all on chicks
 Hundred-thousand dollar car for what  These bitches
 Ten million dollar crib for what  These bitches
 Five thousand dollar suits for what  These bitches
 Should of known but they only out for your riches
 Some freaks need to be dealt with
 Spread 'em and smack 'em backwards  With a stick
 I guarantee she'll do what you say
 Yeah daddy, no daddy, ok
 Don't tempt me cause I'm close to the edge
 I'm tryin not to lose my head
 Cause you don't really wanna see me show out(show out)
 In the club on free spinning G's(show out)
 Mocca humma 24's on these(show out)
 Yo playa don't make me(show out)
 Cause You don't really wanna see me(show out)
 Akon got a crew so deep(show out)
 From the West Indies to over seas(show out)
