 Yo, excuse me, beg your pardon girl
 Do you have any idea what you starting girl
 You got me tingiling, come to me mingiling
 Steppin off lookin bootylicious and jingiling
 When you walk, I see you baby girl
 When you talk, I believe it baby girl
 I like that, thick-petite n' pretty
 Little touch is a ditty
 Love to work the kitty like purrrrrrr
 She loves to stirr it up purrrrrr
 I can hear her purring up
 Cause shes the type that'll get arousy of
 Get you excited and call her boyfriend up (ohh)
 What's the man without the plan B
 We can meet up at the hutter house for the tiki
 So stand by like a butty pass
 While I watch this beautiful thing shake that ass

 So hot I gon' need some rain in here
 Type to make ex-gangstas bang in here
 Girl you could do anything you want in here
 Clown if you want to, frown if you want to
 You ain't even gotta drop down if you want to
 Cause I'd rather see you shake it standin
 Either way you do it girl you look outstandin (uhhuuuhh)
 And now you got me spending (uhhuuhhh)
 The way you got that body bendin (uhhhuhh)
 Ass like that girl you gotta be kickin
 And we goin to church next day repentent
 Lap dancing for my FA crew
 Slide it ova to boo cause he want some too
 Up in the VIP with no fee
 Blessing you with the G even tho we gettin it free so

 In the back seat of your Mazaratti-ratti
 Jiggle jiggle it to the left (ah ah ah)
 Jiggle jiggle it to the right (ah ah ah)
 Jiggle it to the front then jiggle it to the back
 And jiggle jiggle it all all night (ah ah ah)
