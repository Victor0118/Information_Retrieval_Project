 The Coral

 Unopened door
 On the 13th floor
 Conspiracy in the corridors
 I'll take you down
 Down to cripples crown
 
 What should you say?
 What can you do?
 Satellites are watching you
 I'll take you down
 Down to cripples crown
 I'll take you down
 Down to cripples crown
 
 At this dark hour
 Who'll be there?
 
 Open the door
 If you dare
 Venus fly trap on the stairs
 I'll take you down
 Down to cripples crown
 
 There'll be no time
 There'll be no tears
 The elavator disappears
 I'll take you down
 Down to cripples crown
 I'll take you down
 Down to cripples crown
 Cripples crown
 Cripples crown
 Cripples crown
 Cripples crown
