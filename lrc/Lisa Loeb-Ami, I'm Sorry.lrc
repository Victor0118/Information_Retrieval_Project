      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Lisa Loeb  - Ami, I'm Sorry . Ami, I'm sorry I am calling, but I feel like I want to come home. I'm sorry, I tried, but these tears in my eyes have blurred all my vision. I know it's not safe when you can't see the road, and you always thought that I'd make it alone, but now all I've done is to prove you wrong. Ami, I'm sorry, I want to come home. . Ami, I'm sorry, don't hang up the phone, I know that it's too late to call. What's bothering me's how I can't figure out where I am. It's hard to ask for help from you now, but I've reached the end on the edge of this town, and I don't want to give up, 'cause I'll just let you down. Ami, I'm sorry, I don't even know where I'm calling you from. . Ami, it's raining and I don't really care if I ever see the sun shining again. . Ami, I'm sorry I promised so much. Ami, I'm sorry I'm feeling so lost. Ami, I'm sorry I'm making you sad. I don't know what I'm going to do. But Ami, I'm sorry I am calling Ami, I'm sorry I am calling. . Ami, I'm sorry I'm calling,  but I feel like I want to come home . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
