 (one, two, three, four)
 
 Hey baby come round
 Keep holding me down
 And I'll be keeping you up tonight.
 
 The four letter word got stuck in my head
 The dirtiest word that I've ever said
 It's making me feel alright.
 
 For what it's worth I love you
 And what is worse I really do
 Oh what is worse I'm gonna run run run
 'Till the sweetness gets to you
 And what is worse I love you!
 
 Hey please baby come back
 There'll be no more loving attack
 And I'll be keeping it cool tonight.
 
 The four letter word is out of my head
 Come on around get back in my bed
 Keep making me feel alright.
 
 For what it's worth I like you
 And what is worse I really do
 Things have been worse
 And we had fun fun fun
 'Til I said I love you
 And what is worse I really do!
 
 For what it's worth I love you
 And what is worse I really do.
 (oh...)
 
 For what it's worth I love you
 And what is worse I really do.
 (oh...)
 For what it's worth I love you
 And what is worse I really do....
