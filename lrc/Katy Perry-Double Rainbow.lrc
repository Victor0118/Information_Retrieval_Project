     Double Rainbow 演唱：Katy Perry Lrc By 潇风寒月 QQ:395254794 You're a one of a one A one of a kind That you only once in a lifetime Made to fit like a fingerprint A code that clicks open the gold mine 歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com They say one man's trash is another man's treasure When I found you, it was all pity better  Secretly, I hit the lottery 'Cause you're brighter than all of Northern Lights You speak to me, even in my dreams Wouldn't let you go for even the highest price  They say one man's trash is another girl's treasure So if it's up to me, I'm gonna keep you forever  'Cause I understand you, we see eye to eye Like a double rainbow in the sky And wherever you go, so will I 'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find  Words are phenomenon when you came along Yeah, our chemistry was more than science It was defining, light like lightning, it was striking You couldn't deny it  They say one man's trash is another girl's treasure The two of us together, make everything glitter  'Cause I understand you, we see eye to eye Like a double rainbow in the sky And wherever you go, so will I 'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find  To the bottom of the sea, I'd go to find you Climb the highest peak to be right beside you Every step I take, I'm keeping you in mine  'Cause I understand you, we see eye to eye Like a double rainbow in the sky And wherever you go, so will I 'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find  It's hard to find, It's hard to find Once in a lifetime
