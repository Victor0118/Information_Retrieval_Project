What has happened down here Is the wind has changed Clouds have rolled in from the North And it started to rain It rained real hard And it rained for a real long time 6 feet of water in the street Avangiline The river rolls all day The river rolls all night Some people got lost in the flood Some people got away all right The river had busted through Cleared down to Plucker mine 6 feet of water in the street of Avangiline Louiaiana,Louisiana They are trying to wash us away They are trying to wash us away Oh louisiana,louisiana They are trying wash us away They are trying wash us away Presidend Coolidge come down In a railroad train Little fat man with a note pad in his hand Presidend say little fat man Oh isnt it a shame when tne river had done
