 What did you want
 How could I guess
 You wanted more  I gave you less
 A miracle is all I need
 A bush to burn
 A stone to bleed
    Walking on water
    Water to wine
   Love lasts forever
   Wish you were mine
  
 What did I take
 That took away
 Desire's spark
 A lover's blaze
 Stone cold skin
 A bitter breeze
 A miracle is all I need
  My Love lasts forever
  I Wish you were mine
