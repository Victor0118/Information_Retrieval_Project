Ha ha, unh, yeah yeah 
Jazzy Jeff, Fresh Prince and uh 
Jazzy Jeff, Fresh Prince and uh 
Little taste of the old school 
Jazzy Jeff, yo, break it down one time 
Say what? 
Unh, unh, unh, unh 
One for the treble, two for the bass 
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince back up in your face 
Me and Jeff again, "Oh my" you say 
1985 to the Y2K 
The new millenium, propehicies, I''m fulfillin'' ''em 
Everywhere I go, people be yelling "yo, that''s Will and them" 
(so fresh) 
I check the rhyme like Quest 
Some jokes dropped them doo-doo rhymes at my rest 
The B-I-G, W-I-L-L 
King of swing, and I rock well 
The nail in the coffin of your average rapper 
Jeff do the ditto for your average scratcher 
Stature of a rapper slash actor 
Back to the future on wax 
The future of rap 
Tap like Gregory Hines, read the headlines 
Hip-hop''s number one son still shines 
''Cause I''m (so fresh) 
Big Will is (so fresh) 
Jazzy Jeff is (so fresh) 
West Philly is (so fresh) 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
Biiiiiz... Marrrr... KIE! 

  
Yes y''all and to the funky beat and 
Everytime you hear me rhyme, y''all be freakin'' 
The B-I-Z will wreck it, R-O-C-K it 
You''re guaranteed to like me, for what I am sayin'' 
To all those other emcees that be tryin'' to get the info 
Forget the rest ''cause I''m the best, and I''m a nympho- 
Maniac, insaniac, I''ll put you in a trance and 
Always keep it tight, cuz, no matter what type was 
In, you know I''m fresh in flavor 
Yeah, that''s right, I''m talkin'' ''bout me 
The R-K-I-E in the place to be 
I recognize and hypnotize, everytime I tenderize 
I specialize and open eyes, to make you realize 
That you''ve been rocked with Jeff''s plain skills 
The diobolocal, and my man Will 
And we''re (so fresh) 

  
Ha, Big Will is (so fresh) 
Biz Mark is (so fresh) 
Jazzy Jeff is (so fresh) 
Biz, do it 
Whoo, for the old school 
Unh, unh, ha ha 
Ladies and gentlemen 
Rrricky... D! 

  
Well once upon a time eccentric head shorty 
Where people wore pijamas and went to bed early 
There was a little boy, tight clout that might sprout 
Tried to help lead black folk the right route 
Delayed, 
Negative voices, many, once in prison for unwise choices that he once 
made* 
Divide the men, cops were sent inside of him 
And seeing the good he had within him, let him out again 
The life no longer for a big time baller, vic 
Big Willies like Will Smith now call the kid (yo Rick) 
So check the gift, everything no negative 
That''s what happens when you steer black folk away from 
negative* 
Not to mention chasin'' charts, killin'' ''em 
There''ll be a member of the Biz-Mark, Will, and Rick 
Demise sent, can''t mess with the mindset 
Come run with us, December 1999 said 
It''s all because of you, I''m feelin'' sad and blue 
You went away, now my life is just rainy days 
I love you so, how much, you''ll never know 
You took your love away from me 
Oh oh oh oh 
You took your love away from me 
Oh oh oh oh 
You took your love, you took your love, you took your love 
You took your love away from me 
Slick Rick 
Will Smith 
Biz Mark 

  
True dat, true dat 
Jazzy Jeff y''all
