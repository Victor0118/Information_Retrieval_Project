 I'm not a perfect person
 As many things I wish I didn't do
 But I continue learning
 I never meant to do those things to you
 And so I have to say before I go
 That I just want you to know
 
 I've found a reason for me
 To change who I used to be
 A reason to start over new
 and the reason is you
 
 I'm sorry that I hurt you
 It's something I must live with everyday
 And all the pain I put you through
 I wish that I could take it all away
 And be the one who catches all your tears
 Thats why i need you to hear
 
 I've found a resaon for me
 To change who I used to be
 A reason to start over new
 and the reason is You  
 
 I'm not a perfect person
 I never meant to do those things to you
 And so I have to say before I go
 That I just want you to know
 
 I've found a reason for me
 To change who I used to be
 A reason to start over new
 and the reason is you
 I've found a reason to show
 A side of me you didn't know
 A reason for all that I do
 And the reason is you
