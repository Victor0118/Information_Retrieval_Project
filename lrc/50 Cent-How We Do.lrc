  This is how we do
  We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
  This is how we do
  Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
  This is how we do
  We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
  This is how we do
  Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love


 Fresh like, unhh; Impala, unnh
 Crome hyrdolics, 808 drums
 You don't want, none
 Nigga betta, run
 When beef is on, I'll pop that, trunk
 Come get, some
 Pistol grip, pump
 If a nigga step on my white Air, Ones
 Since red, rum
 Ready here I, come
 Compton, unh
 Dre found me in the, slums
 Sellin that skunk, one hand on my gun
 I was sellin rocks when Master P was sayin "Unnnh"
 Buck pass the blunt
 These G-Unit girls just wanna have, fun
 Coke and rum
 Got weed on the ton
 I'm bangin with my hand up her dress like, unh
 I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
 Whole gang in the front in case a nigga wanna, stunt


 I put Lamborghini doors on that Es-co-lade
 Low pro so look like I'm riding on blades
 In one year mang, a nigga's so paid
 I have a straight bitch in the telly goin both ways (Ah!)
 Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
 I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
 You know I'm rockin with the best tre pound on my hip
 Teflon on my chest
 They say I'm no good
 Cuz I'm so hood
 Rich folks do not want me around
 Cuz shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
 Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
 They call me new money, say I have no class
 I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
 The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
 Bougie ass bitches, you can kiss my ass




 I put gold Daytonas on that Cherry Six-Four
 White walls so clean it's like I'm riding on bulbs
 Hit one switch mang, that ass so low
 Cali got niggaz in New York riding on hundred spokes
 Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
 I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
 You know I'm rockin with the best fo' pound on my hip
 Gold chain on my chest (Ah!)


 50, unh
 Bentley, unh
 Em came 'n gotta nigga fresh out the, slum
 Automatic, gun
 Fuck 'em one-on-one
 We wrap up ya punk ass, stunt 'n ya done
 Homie, it's Game time

 You ready? Here I come
 Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker, crunk
 It took two, months
 But Fifty got it done
 Signed with G-unit
 Had niggaz like, "huh?"
 Don't try to front
 I'll leave yo' ass, slumped
 Thinkin I'm a punk
 Get your fuckin head, lumped
 Fifty got a, gun

 Ready here he come
 Gotta sick, vendetta
 To get this, chedda
 Meet my Ba, Retta
 The dra-ma, setta
 Sip Am-a, retta
 My flow sounds, betta
 Than average
 On tracks I'm a savage
 I damage
 Any nigga tryin' to front on my clique (G-Unit!)
