 
 Everclear
 So Much For The Afterglow
 Everything To Everyone
 You put yourself in stupid places
 Yes I think you know it's true
 Situations where it's easy to look down on you
 I think you like to be the victim
 I think you like to be in pain
 I think you make yourself a victim
 Almost every single day
 (Chorus)
 You do what you do
 You say what you say
 You try to be everything to everyone
 You know all the right people
 You play all the right games
 You always try to be
 Everything to everyone
 Yeah you do it again
 You always do it again
 You say they taught you how to read and write
 Thy taught you how to count
 I say they taught you how to buy and sell
 Your own body by the pound
 I think you like to be their simple toy
 I think you love to play the clown
 I think you are blind to the fact
 That you hand you hold
 Is the hand that holds you down
(Chorus)
You do what you do
You say what you say
You try to be everything to everyone
You know all the right people
You play all the right games
You always try to be
Everything to everyone
 Spin around and fall down
 Do it again
 You stumble and you fall
 Yeah why won't you ever learn
 Spin around and fall
 I wonder if you will ever learn
 Why won't you ever learn
 Come on now
 Do that stupid dance for me
 You do what they tell you to do
 You say what they say
 You try to be
 Everything to everyone
 You jump through the big hoop
 You play all the right games
 You try to be
 Everything to everyone
 Spin around and fall down
 Do it again
 You stumble and you fall
 Yeah you do it again
 Spin around and fall down
 Do it again
 You stumble and fall...
