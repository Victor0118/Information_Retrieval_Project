 come, stop your crying, it will be all right 
 just take my hand, hold it tight 
 i will protect you from, all around you 
 i will be here, don't you cry 
 
 for one so small, you seem so strong 
 my arms will hold you, keep you safe and warm 
 this bond between us, can't be broken 
 i will be here, don't you cry 
 
 cause you'll be in my heart 
 yes, you'll be in my heart 
 from this day on
 now and forever more 
 you'll be in my heart 
 no matter what they say 
 you'll be here in my heart always
 
 why can't they understand the way we feel?
 they just don't trust, what they can't explain 
 i know we're different but, deep inside us 
 we're not that different at all 
 
 and you'll be in my heart 
 yes, you'll be in my heart 
 from this day on,
 now and forever more 
 
 don't listen to them
 cause what do they know?
 we need each other, to have to hold 
 they'll see in time
 i know 
 when destiny calls you, you must be strong 
 i may not be with you, but you've got to hold on 
 they'll see in time
 i know
 we'll show them together cause 

 you'll be in my heart 
 believe me, you'll be in my heart 
 i'be there from this day on
 now and forever more 
 oh ,you'll be in my heart (you'll be here in my heart)
 no matter what they say 
 i'll be with you be here in my heart( i'll be there always )
  always
 i'll be with you 
 i'll be there for you, always 
 always and always
 just look over your shoulder 
 just look over your shoulder
 just look over your shoulder
 i'll be there, always
