 I was stained with a role in a day not my own
 But as you walked into my life
 you showed what needed to be shown 
 And I always knew what was right,
 I just didn't know that I might 
 Peel away and choose to see
 with such a different sight
 
    And I will never see the sky the same way
    And I will learn to say good-bye to yesterday
    And I will never cease to fly if held down
    And I will always reach too high 
    'Cause I've seen, 'cause I've seen
   Twilight
    
 Never cared, never wanted,
 never sought to see what flaunted 
 So on purpose, so in my face,
 couldn't see beyond my own place
 And it was so easy not to behold what I could hold 
 But you taught me I could change
 whatever came within these shallow days
 
 As the sun shines through it
 pushes away and pushes ahead
 It fills the warmth of blue
 and leaves a chill instead
 And I didn't know that
 I could be so blind to all that is so real
 But as illusion dies
 I see there is so much to be revealed

 I was stained by a role in a day not my own
 But as you walked into my life
 you showed what needed to be shown
 I always knew what was right,
 just didn't know that I might 
 Peel away and choose to see
 with such a different sight
