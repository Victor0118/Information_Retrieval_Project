 Check it, check it, check it, uhh
 I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me
 And uhh, she got the hots for me the finest thing my hood done seen
 But oh no, oh no, she gotta a man
 and a son, doh'ohhh, but that's okay
 Cause I, wait for my cue and just listen, play my position
 Like a shortstop, pick up e'rything mami hittin
 And in no time.. (no time) I..
 I plan to make this wah-one mi-i-ne.. and that's for sure
 Cause I, I never been the type to, break up a happy home
 But uh, there's somethin bout baby girl I just can't leave alone
 So tell me ma what's it gonna be? She said
 (You don't know what you mean to me)
 
 
 Check it, check it, check it, uhh

 I know how niggaz start actin trippin out here about they girls
 And there's no way-ayy-hey, Nelly gon' fight over
 no day-hey-ame.. as you can see
 But I, I like your steez, your style, your whole demeanor
 The way you come through and holla and swoop me in his 2-seater
 Now that's gangstah-ah-ahhh..
 And I got special ways to thank yah-ah-ahhh.. don't you forget it
 But uh, it ain't that easy for you to pack and leave him
 But uh, you and dirty got ties for different reasons
 I respect that and right before I turn to leave, she said
 
   Sing it for me K
