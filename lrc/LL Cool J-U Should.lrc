 Uhh.. yeah
 Uh-huh.. uh-huh
 Uhh.. yeah
 Uh-huh..

 
 I'ma make you feel good (uhh)
 It'll be my pleasure to take you out the hood (yeah)
 Let you shop 'til you drop
 Let you pick your own rocks
 I'ma carry the bags
 Tell you little things, make you giggle and laugh
 In the.. strawberry bubblebath
 The future's bright, baby forget about the past (yeah)
 Get your toes done (uhh)
 Sacrifice our love for no one (uh-uh)
 French perfume
 Brand new mansion, let you decorate the rooms (hoo)
 Breakfast in the suite (yeah)
 Walk hand in hand in the French Riviera streets
 Make no mistake
 I'ma get you what you want, girl whatever it takes (yeah)

[Chorus: sung + (LL)]
 You.. should know, how to treat, your girl, playboy
 (You should know how to treat her)
 You.. should know, how to treat, your girl, playboy
 (That's your girl playboy)

 
 I'ma caress your face (uhh)
 Give you the keys to your new place
 Just don't touch my safe (ahaha)
 That's forbidden fruit, and that would be a waste
 Which bracelet you want? (huh?)
 What shoes you wanna flaunt? (huh?)
 You like the Gucci joints
 Or the Manolo Blahniks cause they ultra sheek
 Have you lookin like a runway model (uhh)
 Sippin Perrier your way out of custom bottles
 Aromatherapy and massages
 Take you to church baby, teach you who God is (amen)
 Tell me what you like (uhh)
 Where you wanna go, we goin there tonight
 No question I'm the real McCoy
 You ain't gotta be a pimp if she loves you playboy

 
 You.. should know, how to treat, your girl, playboy
 (You should know how to treat her)
 You.. should know, how to treat, your girl, playboy
 (That's your girl playboy)
 

 
 I tease you with the tip (mmm)
 I'll bite your bottom lip (mmm)
 Make you climax real quick
 Over and over again, it's sick
 Orderin your favorite food (mmm)
 Incense and candles, I set the mood
 Tear you up on Playstation 2
 You on the phone with your aunt cause I'm lacin you (uhh)
 Pillow fights in the waterbed, mirrors on the ceiling (yeah)
 Hot and sweaty, clothes start peeling
 Why you think the waterfall's in the shower
 Float with me, the world is ours
 You a pretty little thing, y'know?
 You keep me hungry, make me wanna get dough
 That's why I take care of you
 Most men can't do what I do, y'know?

 
  You.. should know, how to treat, your girl, playboy
  (You should know how to treat her)
  You.. should know, how to treat, your girl, playboy
  (That's your girl playboy)
 
 
 Yeah, treat you right baby
 
 I'll treat you right, yeah..
