 Uhh
 Yeah, yeah 
   "Oh my God"
 Uhh (he's back) success (he's back)
   "They love success!"
 (Where you been?)
 Right here baby

 
 Look in the mirror while I tell you a tale
 About a mogul named Uncle L
 Sit on eight figures, man with a vision, move with precision
 (He excels, they all fail)
 Undisputed, the game got so polluted
 that he turned his +Radio+ off
 He +Needed a Beat+ so he could +Jingle+ them bells again
 Watchin the plasma TV in the loft (with somethin soft)
 with a leapord print outfit on
 Cause he known to flood any mic he spit on
 He's a (uhh uhh, Phenomenon)
 Ice glistenin, listenin to Break of Dawn
 He went from.. Hollis to Hollywood in fact
 Owned the Dow Jones and stacked the NASDAQ
 Conference call with his broker, 'What's the yield on that?'
 "Exotic Motorcars," we want a deal on that

[Chorus: sung + (LL)]
 Mirror mirror (you go baby) speak to me (you flow baby)
 What's this image that I see before me (you know baby)
 It's a winner (you go baby) please believe it (you go baby)
 I can see it so I can achieve it (you flow baby, you go baby)

 
 (Around the Way Girls) be Doin' It well
 They love the way that man look on the (XXL)
 On the Money magazine covers
 When he stop at the light, it's like his Benz hovers
 Smoke blowin from the chrome exhaust, of his Boxer Porsche
 (Look at him, lickin his lips when his joint pull off)
 Ever since +Boomin' System+, damn she missed him
 She, couldn't resist him, dreamt she kissed him
 In a, warm jacuzzi full of +Milky Cereal+
 She said (I need love from the grand imperial)
 I been his biggest fan since five years old
 And now I'm 22, I love money (oooh)
 +Backseat of the Jeep+, you need that
 (Who do you love?) Baby repeat that
 (Who do you love?) You need to keep back
 Milk and +Pink Cookies+ he known to eat that

 
 Mirror mirror (you go baby) speak to me (you flow baby)
 What's this image that I see before me (you know baby)
 It's a winner (you go baby) please believe it (you go baby)
 I can see it so I can achieve it (you flow baby, you go baby)

 
 Tryin to get as much money as possible, no negative consequences
 Knahmsayin baby? I'm goin long, feel me..
 
 Hey Lover, I'm Loungin'
 Goin' Back to Cali, cop a crib on the mountain
 Strobelights jumpin off, birdies is bouncin
 (4) to the 3-2-1, he stopped countin
 Eliminated competition quickly
 Phantom of the Opera on the low where your clique be
 He feel his flow deep down in your artery
 Peep her man's checkbook (uh) that's where his heart'll be
 6 Minutes of Pleasure+ for Jack the Ripper
 Young players fall quicker from chicks and hard liquor (ahahah)
 But uhh, he's Bad, he got The Power of God
 In the Four Seasons, laughin at the L'urmitage(?)
 He been there, mini-bars, R&B stars
 Young groupies in the lobby on the search for (Bobby)
 Young tycoon in the Steve Wynn suite
 Readin e-mails with ten on repeat, I seen it

[Chorus + (LL speaking over, can't be heard clearly)]
 Mirror mirror (you go baby) speak to me (you flow baby)
 What's this image that I see before me (you know baby)
 It's a winner (you go baby) please believe it (you go baby)
 I can see it so I can achieve it (you flow baby, you go baby)

 
 Yeah, 10, faith, power of God
 Yeah, c'mon, work it with me baby
 Work with me ma, uhh, it's been too long, 10
