      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Sunday New York Times - Matt Nathanson . Leaves and the rain falling outside. Taxi waited in the street. Gave you my keys, told you I'd try... But we both knew better, didn't we? I made my way to JFK in world record time, Hoping I would miss the flight. . You and I were fighting sleep. Beautiful wasted promises we promised to keep, At least 'til we said goodbye. Sometimes you're still mine Between the lines of the Sunday New York Times. . You were the saint, I was the liar, At least that's how I remember it. Left all our dreams, all our desires On the steps of your apartment. The Brooklyn bridge, your olive skin Framed in black and white. I miss how simple love could be. . When you and I were fighting sleep. Beautiful wasted promises we promised to keep, At least 'til we said goodbye. Sometimes you're still mine Between the lines of the Sunday New York Times. . Running wild down st. Marks, Raw and breathless in your arms. Jumping trains to the park, When the world was ours. . When you and I were fighting sleep. Under the blankets, promises we promised to keep, At least 'til we said goodbye. Sometimes you're still mine Between the lines of the Sunday New York Times. . 歌词编辑：活在當下     QQ：6313827
