 Stand up straight
 Do your trick
 Turn on the stars
 Jupiter shines so bright
 When you're around to tell us slow down,
 We're too young you need to grow
 The speed's the key
 And they don't know who we are
 And who's to say that we're not good enough?
 And who's to say that this is not our love?
 Mother don't tell me friends are the ones that I lose
 'Cause they'd bleed before you
 And sometimes family are the ones you'd choose
 It's too late now
 I hold on to this life I found
 And who's to say we won't burn it out?
 And who's to say we wont sink in doubt?
 Who's to say that we wont fade today?
  Who are they anyway? Anyway they don't know
  And you say we're too young, but maybe you're too old to remember
 And I try to pretend but I just feel it when we're together
 And if you don't believe me, you never really knew us
 You never really knew
 You and I, packin' up my room, we feel alright
 But we're not well consumed
 We'll be drivin', 'cause they don't know who we are
 Who's to say we won't stay together?
 Who's to say we aren't getting stronger?
 Who's to say I can't live without you?
 And I try to pretend, but I just feel it when we're together
 Who is to say?
 And who is to say?
 And who are they anyway?
 Stand up boy, I shine so bright when you're around
