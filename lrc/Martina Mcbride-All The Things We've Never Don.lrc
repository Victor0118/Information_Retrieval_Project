      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Martina McBride – All The Things We've Never Done . They drank their anniversary glass A silent moment passed Then they kissed She knows there's something on his mind He'll tell her in due time What it is . He says "I've never built Your mansion on a hill Or warmed you in the Spanish sun I simply blink my eye And think as years fly by Of all the things we've never done" . She smiles and takes his hand in hers And says "It just occurred To me now The thought that brings you such regret What hasn't happened yet It makes me proud" . "You never walked away When I needed you to stay Or made me feel I'm not the one There've been no broken vows And the reason we're here now Is all the things we've never done" . "We've never grown apart You never broke my heart With secrets that you've kept me from We've never been untrue And I'm still here with you Through all the things we've never done" . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
