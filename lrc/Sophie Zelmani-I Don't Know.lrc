Are you scared, are you worried to for how far you and I will go.
Have you noticed we're part of this town where there are divorces and break ups all around.
I don't know if it feels good to say, we did the best we could.
There's so many people, everywhere that we are letting interfere.
And if someone's good enough it could be the end for us.
I don't know if it's enough to hope it's only up to us.
