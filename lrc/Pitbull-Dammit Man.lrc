Dammit man (Lil Jon), D-D-Dammit man 
(Pitbull) D-D-Dammit man, D-D-Dammit man 
Dammit man (Lil Jon), D-D-Dammit man 
(Pitbull) D-D-Dammit man, D-D-Dammit man 

  
When you see dem boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! 
(Dammit man!)   

(What? Fuck with us, what) 
Y'all really can't fuck with us 
(Fuck with us, what) 
Y'all really can't fuck with us 
(Fuck with us, what) 
Y'all really can't fuck with us 
(Fuck with us, what) 
Y'all really can't fuck with us 
Y'all really can't fuck with us 

  
I'ma kill 'em in the club with this one 
I'ma tear the club the fuck up 
I'ma have 'em goin' to war over this one 
Partna, just listen 
If you don't want those things to click-clack 
Take a few steps back 
Because I'm playin fo' keeps, go ahead keep playin with me 
And watch how I hit 'em in the head once again 
For those who didn't believe in the kid 
Yall might as well be dead 
because what y'all thought couldn't be done, I did 
I'm like ray charles dawg, I don't see none of y'all 
I'm blind to the fact that half of y'all rap, 
and I'm outrunnin y'all 
When I hit 'em from the back 
I got them mami's saying dammit man 
When I put it in they mouth 
I got them mami's saying duh-huh-huh-muhh (Time out!, whoo) 
When I hit 'em from the back 
I got them mami's saying dammit man 
When I put it in they mouth 
I got them mami's saying duh-huh-huh-muhh 
Put that up dammit 
But me and you both know that these niggaz ain't ready 
They're just too petty, I'm just too deadly (Whoo!) 

  

  
Pitbull's that underrated, underdog, killin' the underground 
But that's just an understatement 
It's hard to understand why I'm still underpaid 
Just look in my blue eyes and see the hunger and pain, 
dammit man 
But I don't plan it man, 
because I do what I wanna do, move what I wanna move 
Y'all gonna see what I mean when I live out my dreams 
I'ma tell you like biggie told me, 
cash rules everything around me 
I could give a fuck about what you say about me 
cause when those things get pulled 
out and squeezed, they'll spray about three 
Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, 
give it up, thats how it goes 
Pit's gon spit it up, flip it up, rip it up, 
but I'm a pro (Time out!, whoo) 
Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, give it up, thats how it goes 
Pit's gon spit it up, flip it up, rip it up, 
but I'm a pro (Time out!, whoo) 
So all ya'll amateur ass niggaz do-don't try to sit home 
Pit's co-co-comin, runnin gunnin fo-fo that throne 

  

(What? Fuck With Us, What) 
Yall really can't fuck with us 
(Fuck With Us, What) 
Yall really can't fuck with us 
(Fuck With Us, What) 
Yall really can't fuck with us 
(Fuck With Us, What) 
Yall really can't fuck with us 
Yall really can't fuck with us
