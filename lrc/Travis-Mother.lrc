     Mother - Travis  歌词千寻www.lrcgc.com lryics by：Stefan QQ：695452483  Mother take that ride  You got in my mind  Tell'em what you found  Write it down  What you have is enough What you want with so much stuff What you need is a hug From a passenger you love One you love  One you love  One you love  One you love  Write a book Change your name Run a thousand miles away Bite the hook Change your game In the end it's all the same  Happy ever after Dancing with disaster Hold me close and listen to the song Why did we wait so long? Ohhhh Why did we wait so long?  Once upon a cold and starless night  Saw a vision or a trick of light  We know there's nothing wrong  Days are short nights are long  Answer me this question then I'm gone  Ohhh why did we wait so long?  Ohhh why did we wait so long?  Ohhh why did we wait so long?  Ohhh why did we wait so long?  Ohhh why did we wait so long?
