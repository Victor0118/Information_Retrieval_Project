 Where I lay my hat may not be my home, but I will last on my own
 'Cause it's me, and my life
 it's my life
 Oh the world has sat in the palm of your hand not that you'd see
 and I'm tired and bored of waiting for you
 and all those things you never do
 'Cause it's me, and my life
 it's my life
 it's my life
