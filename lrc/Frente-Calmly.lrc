 shape
 calmly
 －guity－
         here you come to calmly kill the
         drum behind my eyes
        when water turns to solid
         call out to passersby
       when bullets turn to splinters
 you are something,
 you have something,
 have nothing,
   you have nothing
   you are something

  you want something,
    you want,
  something
  i am
  i believe
