 Sittin' behind a desk...
 How bad do you wanna be a star, boy? Be a star, boy?
 The mansion on the hill could be yours...
 Fancy cash and girls...
 How bad do you wanna be a star, boy? Be a star, boy?
 Finish me off unto yourself...
 Put this heroin in your arms...you're on your way...
 I think we could do business boy...
 It's a crazy business, but it's worth it...
 How bad do you wanna be a star, boy? Be a star, boy?
