     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Feel (Hot Single Mix) - Chicago So everybody's pulling you in all directions You don't know how much longer to take it  So you've learned how to fake it  That smile on the outside's fading fast Like the things that you thought for sure would last But they didn't  You know something's missing  Is it your life you're not living?  Your heart is cold, your soul is numb You don't like who you've become You played the game and paid the cost for long enough  So grab the reins, yeah, take the wheel Lose what's not and keep what's real  It's not too late, Just close your eyes and feel, feel  You can't tell if you're happy or sad  Can't tell the good from bad It's senseless To waste your senses  Maybe stop thinking with your head  Start using your heart instead  Just try it You just might like it  Aren't you dying to start livin'?  Your heart is cold, your soul is numb You don't like who you've become You played the game and paid the cost for long enough  So grab the reins, yeah, take the wheel Lose what's not and keep what's real  It's not too late, Just close your eyes and feel, feel Every breath that's going thru you Take each day that's given to you  To love back the ones who love you  Your heart is cold, your soul is numb You don't like who you've become You played the game and paid the cost for long enough  So grab the reins, yeah, take the wheel Lose what's not and keep what's real  It's not too late,  Just close your eyes and feel, feel  Your heart is cold, your soul is numb  Yeah, yeah, yeah...  You've played the game for long enough, oh, no, no, Everybody's pulling you in all directions.  陈先生 QQ：1552195557
