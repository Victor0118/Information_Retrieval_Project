     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Personal Space Invader(LP Version) - Sugar Ray Sometimes I just want to be left alone  Move your big head It's my way go and get your own  I don't care about the things you do I don't care about the things you do I don't care about the things you do I don't care about, I don't care about All my friends can't relate No time off to hesitate  To my head touch my face Two steps back you're in my space  One more impossible to associate  Got the high score Forgot to put the letterage  I don't know about the things you do I don't know about the things you do I don't know about the things you know about  The things I know about the things you do All my friends can't relate  No time off to hesitate  Feel my head touch my face Two steps back you're in my space  The valeting that we make Or the illegal pictures on the net  Remember how we told you well  And that your playground is a gate to Hell  I don't know about the things you do I don't know about the things you do I don't know about the things you do I don't know care about  All my friends can't relate No time off to hesitate  Feel my head touch my face Two steps back you're in my space  Can you sing?  I don't know about the things you do I don't know about the things you do I don't care about the things you do I don't care about I don't care about All my friends can't relate No time off to hesitate  Feel my head touch my face Two steps back you're in my space  Personal space invader Personal space invader Strange how you find out later Personal space invader  陈先生 QQ：1552195557
