      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Bad Religion - Past Is Dead . Solemn regret, transgressions fill my head A measure of success is how well to forget And the past is dead . Strewn about the battlefield of life are the remainders of history When convenient we exalt them and pay them such respect As if we're all in an equivalent trajectory . And trash piles high in the rubble we forgot The angels of our nature just sit and watch it rot . Now, the past is dead Let's focus on tomorrow instead Oh the tragic present said The past is dead . Who can say what constitutes the most important sector of society?  The dominant portion seek an instant gratification And are proud of intellectual poverty . I'd like to be empathetic but I can't The jeopardy is too great to make a stand . Now the past is dead Good deeds won't help you get ahead The modern signpost read the past is dead . My next great decision is just lying in wait The action might turn out to be the world's most grievous mistake .  The past is dead More veritable words have never been read The tragic present said the past is dead . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
