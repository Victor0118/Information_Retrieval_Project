 Wit the top down feeling the sounds
 Quakin' and vibratin' your thighs ridin' harder than guys
 Wit the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
 When them flames be spittin' at you tell 'em don't even try it
 To shot it wit Chelle and kick it wit Kelly or holla at B
 Ya, gotta be g's you way outta your league

 Next to the speakers keep a toy in the trunk of the 'lac
 A reformed D boy use to run into traps
 Still a soldier do to war if you running your trap
 About my girls ain't no thing to put you under the map
 Walk the streets five deep with nothing less than a stack
 And 80 carats on my chest provides a special attraction
 50 G's in my jeans plus the dough from the waller
 It's the reason I'm the king girl, I know what you like

 Hey, see cash money is a army
 I'm walkin' wit purple hearts on me
 You talkin' to the sargeant
 Body marked up like the subway in harlem
 Call him, weezy f baby, please say the baby
 If you don't see me on the block I ain't tryna hide
 I blend in wit the hood, i'm camouflage
 Bandana tied, so mommy join my troop
 Now every time she hear my name she salute
