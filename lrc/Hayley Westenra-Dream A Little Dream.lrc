      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Dream a Little Dream - Hayley Westenra . Stars shining bright above you Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you" Birds singing in the sycamore tree "Dream A Little Dream Of Me" . Say "nightie-night" and kiss me just hold me tight and tell me you miss me While I'm alone and blue as can be Dream A Little Dream Of Me . Stars fading, but I linger on, dear Still craving your kiss I'm longing to linger till dawn, my dear Just saying this . Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you But in your dreams whatever they be Dream A Little Dream Of Me . la la la... . Stars fading, but I linger on, dear Still craving your kiss I'm longing to linger till dawn, my dear Just saying this . Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you  But in your dreams whatever they be Dream A Little Dream Of Me .
