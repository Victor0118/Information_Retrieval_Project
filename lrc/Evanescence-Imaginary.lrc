 I linger in the doorway
 Of alarm clock screaming monsters
 Calling my name
 Let me stay
 Where the wind will whisper to me
 Where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story
 In my field of paper flowers
 And candy clouds of lullaby
 I lie inside myself for hours
 And watch my purple sky fly over me
 
 Don't say I'm out of touch
 With this rampant chaos - your reality
 I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge 
 The nightmare I built my own world to escape
 In my field of paper flowers
 And candy clouds of lullaby
 I lie inside myself for hours
 And watch my purple sky fly over me
 
 Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming
 Cannot cease for the fear
 Of silent nights
 Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming
 The goddess of imaginary light
 
 In my field of paper flowers
 And candy clouds of lullaby
 I lie inside myself for hours
 And watch my purple sky fly over me
 
 
 END
