 Sugar Ray - Whatever We Are    So hard sometimes  Gets so hard sometimes with you    Whatever we are we are  whatever we are  whatever we are  Whatever we are we are  whatever we are    Whatever we are we are  whatever we are  whatever we are  Whatever we are we are  whatever we are  Whatever    I TRY to show you somethin' you would understand  It's gettin' better all the time  But I never think you'd listen to a word I said  Whatever it is we are we are we are  And I said  Whatever we are we are  whatever we are  whatever we are  Whatever we are we are  whatever we are    Whatever we are we are  whatever we are  whatever we are  Whatever we are we are  whatever we are  Whatever    I don't know where to start  I don't know where to stop  It gets so crazy all the time  (wooh) But I just keep tryin'  Not to let you down  Whatever it is we are we are we are  And I said  It gets so hard sometimes  We always change our minds  It gets so hard sometimes with you (wooh)  OUR love is there to find  But it gets so hard sometimes  It gets so hard sometimes with you with you  (Oh pretty baby...you're the one)    Whatever we are we are  whatever we are  whatever we are  Whatever we are we are  whatever we are    Whatever we are we are  whatever we are  whatever we are  Whatever we are we are  whatever we are  Whatever  Whatever we are we are  whatever we are  Whatever we are we are  whatever we are      END
