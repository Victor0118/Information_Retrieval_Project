 
 
 
 
 
 Moon river, wider than a mile
 I'm crossing you in style some day
 Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
 Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way
 Two drifters, off to see the world
 There's such a lot of world to see
 We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend
 My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me
  Moon River, and me
