 I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
 New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
 There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening.
 I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
 You're living for nothing now,
 I hope you're keeping some kind of record.
 Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
 She said that you gave it to her
 That night that you planned to go clear
 Did you ever go clear?
 Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older
 Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
 You'd been to the station to meet every train
 And you came home without Lili Marlene
 And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
 And when she came back she was nobody's wife.
 Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth
 One more thin gypsy thief
 Well I see Jane's awake --
 She sends her regards.
 And what can I tell you my brother, my killer
 What can I possibly say?
 I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you
 I'm glad you stood in my way.
 If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me
 Your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free.
 Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes
 I thought it was there for good so I never tried.
 And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
 She said that you gave it to her
 That night that you planned to go clear --
