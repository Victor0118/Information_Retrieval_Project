 I lie awake at night
 See things in black and white
 I've only got you inside my mind
 You know you have made me blind
 I lie awake and pray
 That you will look my way
 I have all this longing in my heart
 I knew it right from the start
   Oh my pretty pretty boy I love you
   Like I never ever loved no one before you
   Pretty pretty boy of mine
   Just tell me you love me too
   Oh my pretty pretty boy I need you
   Oh my pretty pretty boy I do
   Let me inside
   Make me stay right beside you
 I used to write your name
 And put it in a frame
 And sometime I think I hear you call
 Right from my bedroom wall
 You stay a little while
 And touch me with your smile
 And what can I say to make you mine
 To reach out for you in time 
 Oh pretty boy , pretty boy , pretty boy
 Say you love me too
