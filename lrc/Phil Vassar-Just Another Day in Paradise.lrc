 The kids screaming, phone ringing
 Dog barking at the mailman bringing
 That stack of bills - overdue
 Good morning baby, how are you?
 Got a half hour, quick shower
 Take a drink of milk but the milk's gone sour
 My funny face makes you laugh
 Twist the top on and I put it back
 There goes the washing machine
 Baby, don't kick it.
 I promise I'll fix it
 Long about a million other things
 Well, it's ok. It's so nice
 It's just another day in paradise
 Well, there's no place that
 I'd rather be
 Well, it's two hearts
 And one dream
 I wouldn't trade it for anything
 And I ask the lord every night
 For just another day in paradise
 
 Friday, you're late
 Guess we'll never make our dinner date
 At the restaurant you start to cry
 Baby, we'll just improvise
 Well, plan B looks like
 Dominoes' pizza in the candle light
 Then we'll tippy toe to our room
 Make a little love that's overdue
 But somebody had a bad dream
 Mama and daddy
 Can me and my teddy
 Come in to sleep in between?
 Yeah it's ok. It's so nice.
 It's just another day in paradise.
 Well, there's no place that
 I'd rather be
 Well, it's two hearts
 And one dream
 I wouldn't trade it for anything
 And I ask the lord every night
 For just another day in paradise
 
 Well, it's ok. It's so nice.
 It's just another day in paradise.
 Well, there's no place that
 I'd rather be
 Two hearts
 And one dream
 I wouldn't trade it for anything
 And I ask the lord every night
 For just another day in paradise
 
 For just another day in paradise
 Well, it's the kids screaming
 The phone ringing
 Just another day
 Well, it's Friday. You're late
 Oh yeah
 it's just another day in paradise
