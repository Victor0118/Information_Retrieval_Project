 Well don't you know I need a little indulgence?
 Listen to the hunter becoming hunted
 Every day there's a million advances
 Don't be too forceful, you'll ruin your chances
 Well don't you know that time is a broken glass
 That splinters against the wall?
 But the picture is coming back now baby,
 And I want to take it all
 Don't go making all these promises
 you know you cannot keep
 There's a time to play a king
 and a time to be the thief
 'Cause if you're making all these promises
 you know you cannot keep
 You know time will be the thief
 and your fallen king will end up alone
 
 So let you're body move a little bit closer
 Silent like the sound proceeding a cyclone
 Don't you know that powerful thinking
 Can be a force you don't want to relinquish?
 Well don't you know that,
 They say that hanging on will justify the wait?
 But patience and elated wisdom
 don't share a common phrase
 Don't go making all these promises
 you know you cannot keep
 There's a time to play a king
 and a time to be the thief
 'Cause if you're making all these promises
 you know you cannot keep
 You know time will be the thief
 and your fallen king will end up alone
 
 Well, I'm only hanging on for what goes down
 I'm floating high and my feet don't touch the ground
 I'd take advantage but I can't see through this charade
 So don't you, don't go make it harder than hell
 (Don't go making promises)
 (Don't go making promises)
 'Cause when it comes down to the making
 You better be damned sure you can take it
 Hey baby
 (Don't go making promises)
 (Don't go making promises)
 
 (oh baby,don't you know baby)
  Well don't go making all these promises
  you know you cannot keep
  There's a time to play a king
  and a time to be a thief
  'Cause if your making all these promises
  you know you cannot keep
  You know time will be the thief
 and your fallen king will end up alone
 and your fallen king will end up...
 A fool, a fool, a lonely sorry fool
 Oh baby, 'cause I told you baby
