 
Little Soldiers need love
Little kisses and hugs
Come get wit these thugs
I'm tellin' you I'm livin' it up
We can walk through the park, hold hands to it stop
It's somethin' about you I don't know but it touches my heart
In school you make me blush
Yeah It's all about us
Haters constantly hatin' always talkin' bout us
Understand I'm your man, so why go talk to a friend
Regardless of what they say, we gonna rap to the end
My little mommy, I'm sayin' my little dime piece
My baby, my boo, my future wifey
I'm keepin' it real thats why you friends don't like me
They jealous, they want a little soldier like me

 
Little soldiers need love 
Little soldiers need love
Little soldiers need love
Don't, Don't, Don't hurt me again

 
Four months past
We still pitchin' letters in class
I'm bugs your babes bunny, you always makin' me laugh
We ride bumper cars and rollarcoasters together
Your my best friend, I'll remember you forever
Like when the first time I saw you I just had ta speak
Heard of love it first sight so it just had ta be
I took your hand
Your my girl I'm your man
It's funny ain't it, yesterday we was just friends
Everyday I think about you, some times I dream about you
If I had some corn without you it wouldn't be fair
I know so much about you, look ma there's somethin I need to tell you

 

 
I hear you movin'
What about us? What are you doin'?
Two years now, everything we hoped for is ruined
How could you leave how could you do this to me
I'm to young to be in love, how foolish of me
Thinkin' sometimes love comes to an end
I can't believe it I'm never gonna see you again
How could you hurt me
You said you would never desert me
But these feelings that I have for you
You was my first kiss, my first love
1,000 miles away, we can't even hug
If we could do it all over I would keep it the same
Romeo and Juliett, write your name in the sand
