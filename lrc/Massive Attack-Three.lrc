 Three's my lucky number
 And fortune comes in threes
 But I wish I knew that number
 That even little children seem to see
 
 Oh, I'm missing everything I knew
 It's just so hard to be a child(?)
 
 Oh, i'm missing all the things i knew
 Yet wish i knew nothing at all
 
 I wish i knew nothing at all
 
 Soon i'll have the courage
 To leave my thoughts behind
 I'll give back all the knowledge
 And keep the wisdom precious in my mind
 
 Oh, i'm missing all the things i knew
 I miss them yet i want them gone
 
 Yes, i'm missing all the things i knew
 Yet wish i knew nothing at all
 
 I wish i knew nothing at all
 I wish i knew nothing at all
 
 
 END
