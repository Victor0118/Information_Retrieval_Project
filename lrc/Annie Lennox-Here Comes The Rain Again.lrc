Here comes the rain again 
Falling on my head like a memory 
Falling on my head like a new emotion 
I want to walk in the open wind 
I want to talk like lovers do 
I want to dive into your ocean 
Is it raining with you 

So baby talk to me 
Like lovers do 
Walk with me 
Like lovers do 
Talk to me 
Like lovers do 

Here comes the rain again 
Raining in my head like a tragedy 
Tearing me apart like a new emotion 
Oooooh 

I want to breathe in the open wind 
I want to kiss like lovers do 
I want to dive into your ocean 
Is it raining with you 

So baby talk to me 
Like lovers do 

Here comes the rain again 
Falling on my head like a memory 
Falling on my head like a new emotion 
(here it comes again, here it comes again) 
I want to walk in the open wind 
I want to talk like lovers do 
I want dive into your ocean 
Is it raining with you
