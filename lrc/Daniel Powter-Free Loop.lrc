 I'm a little used to calling outside your name
 I wont see you tonight so I can keep from going insane
 But I don't know enough, I get some kinda lazy day
 Hey yeah
 I've been fabulous through to fight my town a name
 I'll be stooped tomorrow if I don't leave as them both the same
 But I dont know enough, I get some kinda lazy day
 Hey yeah
 Cause it's hard for me to lose
 In my life I've found only time will tell
 And I will figure out that we can baby
 We can do a one night stand, yeah
 And it's hard for me to lose in my life
 I've found outside your skin right near the fire
 That we can baby
 We can change and feel alright
 I'm a little used to wandering outside the rain
 You can leave me tomorrow if it suits you just the same
 But I don't know enough, I need someone who leaves the day
 Hey yeah
 Cause it's hard for me to lose
 In my life I've found only time will tell
 And I will figure out that we can baby
 We can do a one night stand, yeah
 And it's hard for me to lose in my life
 I've found outside your skin right near the fire
 That we can baby
 We can change and feel alright
