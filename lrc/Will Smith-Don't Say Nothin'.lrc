Yo (let's talk about)
When I released my first single back in like '86
People was like oh you know that's popcorn and you know they weak
You know then I mess around I go world trade on them
Bangin out them multi-plats they still got negativity to bring
My thing is you can't say nothing nice don't say nothing

Take your place allow me to flex a taste
As my accomplishments bring up my comp like mase
Face me the star of stage and TV
My face be seen in almost every country
Grammy winner soon to be oscar nominee
Who he that's dressed jiggy straight from West Philly
Thought I was wack cause I wanted to act
Now every brother and his mother that rap be trying to do that
The ill kid
Hundred million dollar bill kid
The one you love to chill with come on keep it real kid
Don't try to act like this summer at the greek
You won't be bumpin the big Willie in your jeep
I know y'all still feel me 
Really don't act silly
Thought I feel off just becuase I left Philly
Took a break from the rap thing went on hiatus
I picked up the art of acting and multiplied papers
I chilled on silk sofas chatting with Oprah
She asked me if it's true that me and Jeff broke up (hell naa)
While y'all kids busy playing drug pimp and playa
I was at my crib in Barbados chillin with Jada to date her
Vertex is me the magnanimous
Got you saying damn I've always been a fan of his
Y'all know how it is oh wait hold up y'all don't
Look here y'all don't say nothing then I won't

Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin)
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin)

Man I love being me ready to rock ya block
With some more hot top not ___ for you to cop
No more mr. nice guy
My whole life I've been smiling when I felt like whiling
Jealousy swinging on me made his attack
(He soft he wack man that ain't real rap)
You believe that
It hurt me at first but it's cool
Took the insults fed em to my ego used it for fuel
Now everywhere I turn a dead end
Hundred women coming at me waving pads and pens
And they be screaming out
(Oh my lord)
Did you see it's that 
(Brother from ID4)
Now can I please get 
(A picture and your signature)
Sure you can miss
(Oh my god my girlfriends they ain't gonna believe this)
Worldwide wait nah hold up galactic
Hear my name don't nothing change but the accent
Bangkok to Madagascar they wanna see me
Princepe in Spain Japan I'm kota ishe
I like my steaks thick and my jets private
And my son to ride in the cockpit
I know hes only four taking lessons from the pilot
While I'm on my cell with my broker getting stock tips
Find a magazine and I read the hottest gossip
Man who'd a thought my life would be such an interesting topic
Well y'all know how it is wait hold up y'all don't
Well look here y'all don't say nothing than I won't

Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin)
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin)
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin) 
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin)

Go ahead adjust the balance and the bass in your speakers
Make sure my voice sounding crisp in your tweeters
I'm about to show you how a man like me works
My shorty get ice five carrots and nothing cheaper
Four five chromed out former two seaters
Fifty inch sony to watch Siskel and Ebert
Cause I'm about to get two thumbs ten toes one knee and probably a couple
Of elbows
Cause yo I'm the man and the whole world knows
Rock film festivals and rap shows
All the critics jealous people and back-stabbers
My so called friends who been nothing but actors
You're way of character but now who's the bomb
It's Will from west Phil just slightly transformed
Y'all know what it is 
Ah damn that's right y'all don't
But look here y'all don't say nothing then trust me I won't

Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin)
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin)
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin)
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin)
Just don't say nothing (don't say nothin)
Just don't say no
