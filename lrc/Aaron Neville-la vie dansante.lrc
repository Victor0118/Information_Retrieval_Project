They can come take it all away Break you heart by the light of day Drown your love in a distant bay so lonely See the ships heading for the rocks See the time melting over the clocks There's a light shadows all the rocks that saves me It saves me That's why I wander and follow La Vie Dansante On the night wind that takes me just where I want That's all I want La Vie Dansante Miss the beat if you close your eyes Every night wears a new disguise And I live when a new surprise surrenders Feel it all with a willing heart Every stop, there's a place to start If you know how to play the part with feeling I play with feeling Why don't you wander and follow La Vie Dansante On the night wind that takes you just where you want That's all you want La Vie Dansante That's why I wander and follow La Vie Dansante On the night wind that takes me just where I want That's all I want La Vie Dansante
