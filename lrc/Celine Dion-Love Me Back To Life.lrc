     Love Me Back To Life - Celine Dion  Lrc By 潇风寒月 QQ:395254794  I was walking dead, stuck inside my head I couldn't get out, turn the lights down The voices inside were so loud  Need a jump-start, catatonia I couldn't feel, I wish that I could disappear The voices inside were so real  But you stood by my side Night after night, night after night You loved me back to life, life  From the coma, the wait is over  You loved me back to life, life  From the coma, we're lovers again tonight  Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life, yeah Woke me up, one touch, and I feel my heart Loved me back to life, back to life, but I died The voices inside were so quiet  But you stood by my side Night after night, night after night You loved me back to life, life From the coma, the wait is over You loved me back to life, life From the coma, we're lovers again tonight Strong hand, thick skin, and an open heart You saw through the pain, saw through the marks You never gave up on me, ohhhh Life,life  歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com
