 Werent't you the one who said that you don't want me anymore 
 And how you need your space and give the keys back to your door
 And how I cry and try and try to make you stay with me
 But still you said the love was gone and that I had to leave
 
 Now you
 Talking about a family
 Now you
 Saying I complete your dream
 Now you
 Saying I'm your everything
 Your confusing me, what your saying to me
 Don't play with me, don't play with me cus
 What goes around comes around
 What goes up most come down 
 Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
 What goes around comes around
 What goes up most come down 
 Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
 
 I remember when I was sitting home alone
 Waiting for you
 To 3 o'clock in the morn'
 
 And when you came home you'd always had some sorry excuse
 And explaining to me like I was some kind of a fool
 I sacrefice the things I want just to do things for you
 But when it's time to do for me
 You never come through
 
 Now you
 Wanna be a part of me
 Now you
 Have so much to say to me
 Now you
 Wanna make time for me
 What you doing to me, your confusing me
 Don't play with me, don't play with me cus
 
 What goes around comes around
 What goes up most come down 
 Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
 What goes around comes around
 What goes up most come down 
 Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
 
 I remember when I was sitting home alone
 Waiting for you
 To 3 o'clock in the morn'
 Night after night knowing something's going on
 What's that number for
 
 Lord knows it wasn't easy believe me
 Never thaught you'd be the one that would deceive me
 And never do what your suppose to do
 No need to punch me boo cus I won't play you cus
 
 What goes around comes around
 What goes up most come down 
 Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
 What goes around comes around (yeah)
 What goes up most come down 
 Gotta stop trying to come back to me
 What goes around comes around 
 What goes up most come down 
 Please come home my baby
 And it goes around
 What goes around comes around 
 What goes up most come down 
 Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
