 Drain the veins in my head
 Clean out the reds in my eyes to get by security lines
 Dear x-ray machine
 Pretend you don't know me so well
 I wont tell if you lied
 Cry, cause the droughts been brought up
 Drinkin' cause you're lookin so good in your starbucks cup
 I complain for the company that I keep
 The windows for sleeping rearrange
 And I'm nobody
 Well who's laughin now
 I'm leaving your town again
 And I'm over the ground that you've been spinning
 And I'm up in the air so baby hell yeah
 Oh honey I can see your house from here
 If the plane goes down, damn
 I'll remember where the love was found
 If the plane goes down, damn
 
 Damn, I should be so lucky
 Even only 24 hours under your touch
 You know I need you so much
 I cannot wait to call you
 And tell you that I landed somewhere
 And hand you a square of the airport
 And walk you through the maze of the map
 That im gazing at
 Gracefully unnamed and feeling guilty for the luck
 And the look that you gave me
 You make me somebody
 Oh nobody knows me
 Not even me can see it, yet I bet I'm
 
 I'm leaving your town again
 But I'm over the quilt that you've spinning
 And I'm up in the air, so baby hell yeah
 Oh honey I can see your house from here
 If the plane goes down, damn
 I'll remember where the love was found
 If the plane goes down, damn
 
 You keep me high minded
 You keep me high
 
 Flax seeds, well they tear me open
 And supposedly you can crawl right through me
 Taste these teeth please
 And undress me from these sweaters better hurry
 Cause I'm keeping upward bound now
 Oh maybe I'll build my house in your cloud
 Here I'm tumbling for you
 Stumbling through the work that I have to do
 Don't mean to harm you
 
 By leaving your town again love
 But I'm over the ground that you've been spinning
 But I'm up in the air, said baby hell yeah
 Oh honey I can see your house from here
 If the plane goes down, damn
 I'll remember where the love was found
 If the plane goes down, damn
 I'll remember where the love was found
 If the plane goes down, damn
 I'll remember where the love was found
 If the plane goes down, damn
 
 You get me high
 You keep me high minded
 You get me high
 You get me high minded
