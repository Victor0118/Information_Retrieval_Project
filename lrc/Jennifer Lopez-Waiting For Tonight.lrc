 
 
 
 Like a movie scene
 In the sweetest dreams
 Have pictured us together
 Now to feel your lips
 On my fingertips
 I have to say is even better
 Then I ever thought it could possibly be
 It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
 From all of my sadness
 The tears that I've cried
 I have spent all of my life
   CHORUS: Waiting for tonight, oh
      When you would be here in my arms
      Waiting for tonight, oh
      I've dreamed of this love for so long
      Waiting for tonight
  Tender words you say
 Take my breath away
 Love me now, leave me never
 Found a sacred place
 Lost in your embrace
 I want to stay in this forever
 I think of the days when the sun used to set
 On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
 Tossing and turning Emotions were strong
 I knew I had to hold on
CHORUS (2x)
 Gone are the days when the sun used to set
 On my empty heart all alone in my bed
 Tossing and turning Emotions were strong
 I knew I had to hold on
CHORUS
