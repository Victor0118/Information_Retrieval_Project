 Bizarre Love Triangle
 
 Every time I think of you
 I feel shot right through with a bow of gloom
 It's no problem of mine
 But it's a problem I find
 Living a life that I can't leave behind
 There's no sense in telling me
 The wisdom of a fool won't set you free
 But that's the way that it goes
 And it's what nobody knows
 While every day my confusion grows
 
   Every time I see you falling
   I get down on my knees and pray
   I'm waiting for that final moment
   You'll say the words that I can't say
 
 I feel fine and I feel good
 I'm feeling like I never should
 Whenever I get this way
 I just don't know what to say
 Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
 I'm not sure what this could mean
 I don't think you're what you seem
 I do admit to myself
 That if I hurt someone else
 Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be
