 My life is brilliant.
 
 My life is brilliant.
 My love is pure.
 I saw an angel.
 Of that I'm sure.
 She smiled at me on the subway.
 She was with another man.
 But I won't lose no sleep on that,
 'Cause I've got a plan.
 
 You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
 You're beautiful, it's true.
 I saw your face in a crowded place,
 And I don't know what to do,
 'Cause I'll never be with you.
 
 Yeah, she caught my eye,
 As we walked on by.
 She could see from my face that I was,
 Fucking high,
 And I don't think that I'll see her again,
 But we shared a moment that will last till the end.
 
 You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
 You're beautiful, it's true.
 I saw your face in a crowded place,
 And I don't know what to do,
 'Cause I'll never be with you.
 
 You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
 You're beautiful, it's true.
 There must be an angel with a smile on her face,
 When she thought up that I should be with you.
 
 But it's time to face the truth,
 I will never be with you.
