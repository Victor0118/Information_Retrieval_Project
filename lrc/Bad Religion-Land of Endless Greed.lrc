      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Bad Religion - Land Of Endless Greed . I don't really care what other people may say I've gotta go on living my life anyway Everything is golden, everything's for sale I'm done with unsubstantiated fairy tales . But out here in the lap of luxury Unlimited guarantee for your insatiable need In the land of endless greed . In the emerald forest hear a nasty sound The big rigs and the miners come and shake the ground On the field of plenty the grazers gather 'round To watch the game of supply and demand go down . But out here in the lap of luxury Unlimited guarantee for your insatiable need In the land of endless greed . I don't really care what other people may say I've gotta go on living my life anyway The poor don't have to struggle in dismal poverty Anyone can be the way they want to be .  Out here in the lap of luxury Fortune bears no scrutiny What you want is all you need In the land of endless greed . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
