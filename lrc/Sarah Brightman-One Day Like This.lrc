     One Day Like This 演唱：Sarah Brightman  LRC编辑:潇风寒月 QQ:395254794  Drinking in the morning sun Blinking in the morning sun Shaking off the heavy one Oh, heavy like a loaded gun What made me behave that way Using words I never say I can only think it must be love Oh anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day  Someone tell me how I feel It's silly wrong, but vivid right Oh, kiss me like the final meal Yeah, kiss me like we die tonight  'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes And only now I see the light Yeah, lying with me half awake Oh, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day  When my face is chamois creased If you think I wink, I did Laugh politely at repeats Oh, kiss me when my lips are thin 'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes And only now I see the light Yeah, lying with you half awake Stumbling over what to say Well, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day  So throw those curtains wide One day like this a year would see me right Throw those curtains wide One day like this a year would see me right         Throw those curtains wide        One day like this a year would see me right (for life)  歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com
