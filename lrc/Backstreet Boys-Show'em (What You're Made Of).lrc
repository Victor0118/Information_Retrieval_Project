     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Backstreet Boys - Show'em (What You're Made Of)  I seen it all a thousand times Fallin' down I'm still alive Am I? Am I? It's hard to breathe when the water's high No need to swim, I learned to fly So high, so high  You find the truth in a child's eyes When the only limit is the sky Living proof I see myself in you  When walls start to close in Your heart is frozen over Just show 'em what you're made of When sunlight is fading The world will be waiting for ya Just show 'em what you're made of  Girl's on your own your ready to fight Like a lion I will survive, Will I? Will I? You gotta stand for something Even if you stand alone, Don't be afraid It's gonna be, alright  You find the truth in a child's eyes When the only limit is the sky Living proof I see myself in you  When walls start to close in Your heart is frozen over Just show 'em what you're made of When sunlight is fading The world will be waiting for ya Just show 'em what you're made of  Just show 'em what you're made of Just show 'em what you're made of  You find the truth in a child's eyes When the only limit is the sky Living proof I see myself in you  When walls start to close in Your heart is frozen over Just show 'em what you're made of (You can show 'em what you're made of) When sunlight is fading The world will be waiting for ya Just show 'em what you're made of Just show 'em what you're made of Splendidyang Backstreet back all right
