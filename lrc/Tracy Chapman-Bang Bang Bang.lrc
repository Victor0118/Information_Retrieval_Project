What you go and do 
You go and give the boy a gun 
Now there ain't place to run to 
Ain't no place to run to 
When he hold it in his hand 
He feel mighty he feel strong 
Now there ain't no place to run to 
Ain't no place to run 

One day he may come back 
Repay us for what we've done 
Then where you gonna run to 
Where you gonna run 

But one fine day 
All our problems will be solved 
Bang bang bang 
We'll shoot him down 

Give him drugs and give him candy 
Anything to make him think he's happy 
And he won't ever come for us 
He won't ever come 

But if he does 
And if there's no one else around 
Bang bang bang 
We'll shoot him down 

If he preys only on his neighbors 
Brothers sisters and friends 
We'll consider it a favor 
We'll consider justice done 

But if he comes for you or me 
And we can place a gun in his hand 
Bang bang bang 
We'll shoot him dead 

What you go and do 
You go and give the boy a gun 
Now there ain't no place to run to 
Ain't no place to run 

Now we'll all be at his mercy 
If he decides to hunt us down 
Cause there ain't no place to run to 
Ain't no place to run 

If he wants the chances that you took from him 
And nothing that you own 
Then there'll be no place to run to 
There'll be no place to run 

And if he finds himself to be 
A reflection of us all 
Bang bang bang 
He'll shoot us down 

Before you can raise your eyes to read 
The writing on the wall 
Bang bang bang 
He'll shoot you down 

Before you can bridge the gulf between 
And embrace him in your arms 
Bang bang bang 
He'll shoot you down
