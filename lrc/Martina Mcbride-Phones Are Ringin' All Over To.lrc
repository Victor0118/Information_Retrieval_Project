      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Martina McBride – Phones Are Ringin' All Over Town . With lipstick on his collar and a trace of cheap perfume He undresses in the darkness and eases into bed With her face turned to the other wall she pretends to be asleep But it doesn't really matter 'cause there's nothing to be said . He calls from work to tell her he's sorry about last night If he uses all the right words she'll forgive him once again But the phone just keeps on ringin' and he knows something's wrong He feels his heart start pounding, and his head begins to spin . Phones are ringin' all over town North and south and east and west on Main Street up and down He's got friends of his callin' friends of hers But she's nowhere to be found Phones are ringin' all over town . He calls the hospital, her sister's house and the place that does her hair God, if somethin' ever happened he'd surely lose his mind And he's thinkin' it's just like she's disappeared into thin air As American flight 204 departed right on time . Phones are ringin' all over town North and south and east and west on Main Street up and down He's got friends of his callin' friends of hers But she's nowhere to be found Phones are ringin' all over town . Well he knows she'd never leave him She's just got to be around Phones are ringin' Phones are ringin' Phones are ringin' all over town . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
