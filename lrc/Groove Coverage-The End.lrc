 My home is in motion, as darkness unfolds.
 The air overloaded, the sky's dancing gold.
 But you went away, you left me to stay
 We'll see us in heaven, I'm counting the days

 At the end of time, at the end of us, 
 At the end of everything we had,
 Only faith helps you, only grace can do
 Only you can take the pain
 Cause the end of peace is the end of life 
 and the end of any happiness
 Only love helps you, only trust can do
 Only you can take the pain of me
 
 When thunder is calling I feel so alive
 The very first morning, can you see the light?
 But you closed the door to what I adored
 We'll see us in heaven, I'm counting no more

 At the end of time, at the end of us, 
 At the end of everything we had,
 Only faith helps you, only grace can do
 Only you can take the pain
 Cause the end of peace is the end of life 
 and the end of any happiness
 Only love helps you, only trust can do
 Only you can take the pain of me
