Everybody''s so mixed up about love these days 
And everybody''s trying to work it out in different ways 
I don''t really need to know your aspirations 
What I need from you babe 
Is good conversation 
To put my mind at ease 
An old friend called the other day 
And wasn''t quite sure what to say 
Didn''t seem to know me anymore 
And I said 
Don''t treat me like I''m someone new 
I''m still the same one you used to talk to 
But all I need from you friend 
Is good conversation 
Is good conversation 
To put my mind at ease 

Though It seems as if the world has come between us 
And our lives don''t look the same 
Though in the past you have shared all my happiness 
Will you be there to share the pain 
Everyday I''m surrounded by 
A million voices from the sky 
And they all have the same thing to say 
Now what I need is something new 
Is it something you can do 
To share in that kind 
Of good conversation 
Is good conversation 
That puts my mind at ease 
Puts my mind at ease 
yeah baby 
(all I need is) 
(all I) 
Woah yeah 
(all I) 
(all I) 
(all I need is) 
Is it my iniagination 
(all I) 
And can you see my frustration 
(all I) 
I don''t need admiration 
(all I) 
But I''m trying to be patient 
What I''m looking for 
(all I) 
Is good conversation 
(all I) 
(all I need is) 
Is it imy imagination 
(all I) 
Could it be my destination 
(all I) 
And what I''m looking for 
(all I) 
is good conversation 
(all I need is) 
And what i''m asking for 
(all I) 
is good conversation 
(all I) 
To put my mind at ease
