 Nirvana
 Smells Like Teen Spirit
 Load up on guns and Bring your friends
 It's fun to lose And to pretend
 She's over bored And self assured
 Oh no, I know A dirty word
 hello, how low? (x bunch of times)
 With the lights out it's less dangerous
 Here we are now Entertain us
 I feel stupid and contagious
 Here we are now Entertain us
 A mulatto An albino
 A mosquito My Libido
 Yeah
 I'm worse at what I do best
 And for this gift I feel blessed
 Our little group has always been
 And always will until the end
 hello, how low? (x bunch of times)
 With the lights out it's less dangerous
 Here we are now Entertain us
 I feel stupid and contagious
 Here we are now Entertain us
 A mulatto An albino
 A mosquito My Libido
 Yeah
 And I forget Just why I taste
 Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
 I found it hard It was hard to find
 Oh well, whatever, nevermind
 hello, how low? (x bunch of times)
 With the lights out it's less dangerous
 Here we are now Entertain us
 I feel stupid and contagious
 Here we are now Entertain us
 A mulatto An albino
 A mosquito My Libido
 Yeah, a denial
 A denial
 A denial...
