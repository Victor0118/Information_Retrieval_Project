 My life goes on in endless song
 above earth’s lamentations,
 I hear the real, though far-off hymn
 that hails a new creation.
 Through all the tumult and the strife
 I hear it’s music ringing,
 It sounds an echo in my soul.
 How can I keep from singing?
 While though the tempest loudly roars,
 I hear the truth, it liveth.
 And though the darkness ’round me close,
 songs in the night it giveth.
 No storm can shake my inmost calm,
 while to that rock I’m clinging.
 Since love is lord of heaven and earth
   how can I keep from singing?
 
 *****
 When tyrants tremble in their fear
 and hear their death knell ringing,
 when friends rejoice both far and near
 In prison cell and dungeon vile
 our thoughts to them are winging,
 when friends by shame are undefiled
