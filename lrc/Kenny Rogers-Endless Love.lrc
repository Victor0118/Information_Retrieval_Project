 Sung By "Kenny Rogers"
 
 My love there's only you in my life
 The only thing That's right
 My first love
 You're every breath that I take
 You're every step I make
 And I...I want to share all my love with you
 No one else will do
 And your eyes(Your eyes your eyes)
 They tell me how much you care oh yes
 You will always be my endless love
 
 Two hearts two hearts that beat as one
 Our lives have just begun
 Forever(Woo oh)
 I'll hold you close in my arms
 I can't resist your charms
 My love(Woo love)
  I'll be a fool for you
  I'm sure
  You know I don't mind(Woh you know I don't mind)
 'Cause you
 You mean the world to me oh
 I know I've found in you(I know I've found in you)
 My endless love
 
 Woo Woo
 Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom
 Bom bom bom bom bom bom
 Woo and love(Woo love)
 And yes(And yes)
 You'll be the ony one
 ('Cause no one can deny)No one can deny
 This love I have inside
 And I'll give it all to you
 (My love)My love my love
 My endless love
 
 The End.
