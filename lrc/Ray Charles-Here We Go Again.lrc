 Ray Charles(with Norah Jones)
 Here We Go Again 
 
 Here we go again
 He's back in town again
 I'll take him back again
  One more time
 Here we go again
 The phone will ring again
 I'll be her fool again
 One more time
   
  I've been there before
  And I'll try it again
  But any fool knows
  That there's no way to win
  Here we go again
  She'll break my heart again
  I'll play the part again
  One more time
