 And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
 A big bow wow wow, cuz we gonna make it a little mystery 
 here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
 slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

 Verse One: Nate Dogg 五邑大学粉果制作

 When I met you last night baby
 Before you opened up your gap
 I had respect for ya lady
 But now I take it all back
 Cause you gave me all your pussy
 And ya even licked my balls
 Leave your number on the cabinet
 And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
 Next time I'm feelin kinda horny
 You can come on over, and I'll break you off
 And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
 Just lay back, and open your mouth
 Cause I have never 
 met a girl
 That I love 
 in the whole wide world

Verse Two: Kurupt 有无人听snoop dogg既歌？

 Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
 I'd never have no motherfuckin indo to smoke
 I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
 Do we like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
 I have no love for hoes
 That's somethin I learned in the pound
 so how the fuck am I supposed
 to pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
 I know the pussy's mine, I'ma fuck a couple more times
 And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
 Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
 Cause she ain't nuthin but a bitch to me
 And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
 i gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
 Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
 Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass beeeitch!

 Chorus: (repeat 4X)

It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

 Verse Three: Snoop Doggy Dogg 
 
 Guess who back in the motherfuckin house
 With a fat dick for your motherfuckin mouth
 Hoes recognize, niggaz do too
 Cuz when bitches get scandolous and pull a voodoo
 What you gon do? You really don't know
 So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
 Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
 Knowin damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
 Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
 How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
 Doggy, I'm all the above
 I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
 But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
 Cause you know I don't love em

 Verse Four: Warren G
 Whoa!
 Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
 One for the money, two for the bitches
 Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
 In my Chevy, six-fo' Red to be exact
 With bitches on my side, and bitches on back
 So back up bitch cuz i'm strugglin, so get
 on your knees and then start jugglin
 these motherfuckin nuts in your mouth
 It's me, Warren G the nigga with the glock
 Whoo!
 粉果全力爱他的小丸子！！！！
