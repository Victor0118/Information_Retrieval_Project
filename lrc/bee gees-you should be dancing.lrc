 You Should Be Dancing
     
  My Baby Moves At Midnight
  Goes Right On Till The Dawn
  My Woman Takes Me Higher
  My Woman Keeps Me Warm
              What You Doin' On Your Back Ah
        You Should Be Dancin' Yeah Dancin' Yeah
 She's Juicy And She's Trouble
 She Gets It Me Good 
 My Woman Gives Me Power
 Goes Right Down To My Blood
