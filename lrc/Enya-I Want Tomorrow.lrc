

Dawn breaks; there is blue in the sky. 
Your face before me though I don't know why.
Thoughts disappearing like tears from the Moon. 
Waiting here, as I sit by the stone, 
they came before me, those men from the Sun.
Signs from the heavens say I am the one. 

Chorus:
Now you're here, I can see your light, 
this light that I must follow. 
You, you may take my life away, so far away. 
Now I know I must leave your spell 
I want tomorrow.

Chorus
