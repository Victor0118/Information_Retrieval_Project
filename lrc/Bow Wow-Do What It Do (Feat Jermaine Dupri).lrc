 Down south let me see what ya bouncin' like
 West coast let me see what ya crumpin' like
 Mid West let me see what ya mono like
 East coast let me see what ya shakin' like
 C'mon
 
 You seen my tapes, seen my shows
 Heard my songs, you know how it goes
 Since 87 I've been having this effect on these females
 Power to make them stand and listen to me like a sea shell
 I got what they want, I know how they like it
 Got what ya need baby please don't fight it
 You know my status, know my flow
 You know thaty nigga that u wit, he aint even close
 
 I'm money in da bag, all I do is pop tags
 Don't you wanna be down,
 with somebody that's gonna make you smile and laugh
 Don't you wanna be down
 I'm young, I'm fly and I got the swag,
 that u need in your life
 I'm a young J.Brown, I'm super bad,
 guaranteed to treat you right
 Let's ride
 All I need is one time and I bet you go crazy
 cuz imma make you do what it do baby
 No if's, no and's, no but's or maybe's
 Cuz imma make you do what it do baby
 Don't worry, don't trip,
 just hurry hurry and bring it over here baby
 Don't worry, don't trip,
 just hurry cuz imma make you do what it do baby
 Ya nigga 18 now, you aint know
 If you touch me like you did when we was kids UH OH
 It's on, its on, imma take ya home
 Im grown , I'm grown, I'll make ya moan
 If you want it, better act like you want it
 cuz the girl right beside you want your spot
 If you know what it is, act like you know,
 bring your pretty self over here and drop it like its hot
 For the Beezy weezy lil like easy,
 say in on the tele and do it like its for tv
 You could win or lose, its up to you how u play it
 You see it, I aint gotta say it,
 im money in the bag all I do is pop tags
 Don't you wanna be down
 With somebody that's gonna make you smile and laugh
 Don't you wanna be down
 All I need is one time and I bet you go crazy
 cuz imma make you do what it do baby
 No if's, no and's, no but's or maybe's
 Cuz imma make you do what it do baby
 Don't worry, don't trip,
 just hurry hurry and bring it over here baby
 Don't worry, don't trip,
 just hurry cuz imma make you do what it do baby
  Down south let me see what ya bouncin' like
  West coast let me see what ya crumpin' like
  Mid West let me see what ya mono like
  East coast let me see what ya shakin' like
 C'mon
 All I need is one time and I bet you go crazy
 cuz imma make you do what it do baby
 No if's, no and's, no but's or maybe's
 Cuz imma make you do what it do baby
 Don't worry, don't trip,
 just hurry hurry and bring it over here baby
 Don't worry, don't trip,
 just hurry cuz imma make you do what it do baby
