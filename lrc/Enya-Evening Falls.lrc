 from within me calls - could it be I am sleeping?
 For a moment I stray, then it holds me completely.
 close to home - I cannot say.
 close to home feeling so far away.

 As I walk the room there before me a shadow
 from another world, where no other can follow.
 carry me to my own, to where I can cross over...
 close to home - I cannot say.
 close to home feeling so far away. 

 Forever searching; never right,
 I am lost in oceans of night. 
 Forever hoping I can find memories.
 those memories I left behind. 

 Even though I leave will I go on believing
 that this time is real - am I lost in this feeling?
 like a child passing through, never knowing the reason.
 I am home - I know the way.
 I am home - feeling oh, so far away.
