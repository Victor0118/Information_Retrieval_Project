 Oh no, I see
 The spider web is tangled up with me
 And I lost my head
 And thought of all the stupid things I'd said

 Oh no, what's this?
 A spider web and I'm caught in the middle
 So I turn to run
 And thought of all the stupid things I'd done

 And I never meant to cause you trouble
 I never meant to do you wrong
 And ah, well if I ever caused you trouble
 Oh, no I never meant to do you harm

 Oh no, I see
 The spider web and it's me in the middle
 So I twist and turn
 But here am I in my little bubble

 Singing out 
 I never meant to cause you trouble
 I never meant to do you wrong
 And ah, well if I ever caused you trouble
 Oh, no I never meant to do you harm

 They spun a web for me
 They spun a web for me
 They spun a web for me
