     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Permanent Stain - Backstreet Boys   Out of the rain, looking for sunshine I call your name, but you're like a ghost I let you disappear, should've never let you go I want to say just for the record That you still got my heart and my soul You know we're worlds apart, yeah I've got to let you know   You are the piece I can't replace, oh You left a mark that won't erase, no   No one else can teach me how to love again ‘Cause you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it  Never mind what people say 'cause they don't understand  How you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it   Some try to break through the walls  Built up but they don't compare to you One chance, I swear I'll never let you go   You are the piece I can't replace, oh You left a mark that won't erase, no   No one else can teach me how to love again ‘Cause you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it  Never mind what people say 'cause they don't understand  How you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it  Ooh ooh ooh ooh  You left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it    One should… with time  Never gonna fade, one can touch the flame and tame the fire  You are the piece I can't replace, oh You left a mark that won't erase, no    No one else can teach me how to love again ‘Cause you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it  Never mind what people say 'cause they don't understand  How you left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it  Ooh ooh ooh ooh  You left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it  Ooh ooh ooh ooh  You left a permanent stain on my heart and I've been feeling it  Backstreet back all right Splendidyang
