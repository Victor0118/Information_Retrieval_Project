     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Backstreet Boys - In Your Arms  Out there in the darkest place Where there's a thousand shades of blue Everyone looks the same then your light came in to view  You stop my heart and got me saying where did you come from Its like you fall out of the sky and save me an angle from the sun   I could live forever in your arms in your arms  Baby we could fly together to the stars back to mars  Where you wanna goooooooooo My future is with you from tonight I could live forever in your arms in your arms   And when I touch your face you chose me worlds I never know  Frozing in time and space dont want to let this moment go  You stop my heart and got me saying where did you come from? Its like you fall out of the sky and save me an angle from the sun   I could live forever in your arms in your arms  Baby we could fly together to the stars back to mars Where you wanna goooooooooo My future is with you from tonight I could live forever in your arms in your arms   Stay with me  Come stay with me forever and ever   Taking me you're taking me to heaven to heaven I could live forever in your arms in your arms  Baby we could fly together to the stars back to mars  I could live forever in your arms in your arms  Baby we could fly together to the stars back to mars Where you wanna goooooooooo My future is with you from tonight I could live forever in your arms in your arms  Splendidyang Backstreet back all right
