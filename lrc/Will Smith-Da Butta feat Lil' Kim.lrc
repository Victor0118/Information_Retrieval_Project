  
Uh, uh, uh 
What? 
Whoo! Ha-ha 
Yeah mic check 
Mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic 
Alright now let''s go yo 

 (Will) 
Here come the butter baby 
(I bring it smooth and hot) 
Here come the butter baby 
(Bringing it smooth and hot) 
Here come the butter baby 
(I bring it smooth and hot) 
What? What? What? What? 

  
Here come the butter baby 
Bringing it smooth and hot 
Got the staff from K-B 
Singing this groove a lot 
So I got my spiral notebook 
Drink and pen 
And then abracadabra y''all, done it again 
Married but I flirt a little 
Siking the ladies 
In the videos I be bringing it like Mike in the 80s 
Level of success based on my level of risk 
You''ve been yelling for the lyricist 
Then reveling this 
Old school hip-hop a beat and a rhyme 
Some chapters and some verses, you seek and you find 
Look no further here I go, Big Will, Johnny Inferno 
Flame by hip-hop burns eternal 
All aboard on my train to fame 
Rappers hoping that it''d rain 
Trying to stop the game 
But rain can''t stop me 
I got a coat in the crib 
Hey look y''all yellow bricks quit beefin'' at the whiz, what? 

 (Will) 
Here come the butter baby 
(I bring it smooth and hot) 
Here come the butter baby 
(Uh, bringing it smooth and hot) 
Here come the butter baby 
(I bring it smooth and hot) 
What? What? What? What? 
(Lil'' Kim y''all what?) 

  
Lil'' Kim, Big Will give a damn how y''all feel 
Hate, but on the real, Big Will is seven mill 
If I wasn''t on top I''d have a lot less ends 
I''d most likely have a lot less friends 
You know what I learned, let them keep talking 
Uh-huh, pull up in an Azure and watch them keep walking 
  
Kim haters be making me wanna flip and react 
  
No-no-no, chill Will and let me do that (alright) 
Huh, I gotta eat can''t get with broke cats 
You know the queen like to be where the money at 
I''m the mother, y''all like adopted in this 
Call us Mr. and Mrs. Papadapolis 
When will y''all learn? 
Y''all just interns 
You gon'' get what you earn, just wait your turn 
I rock telephones with the TV screens 
So I can have real phone sex 
Know what I mean? 

 (Will) 
Here come the butter baby 
(I bring it smooth and hot) 
Here come the butter baby 
(Bringing it smooth and hot) 
Here come the butter baby 
(Yo I bring it smooth and hot) 
What? What? What? What? 

  
It''s the fun king, I''ve been doing one thing 
Running things for years, give me one swing 
And it''s out of here, crack! 
Over the fence ladies and gents 
Keeping rappers impressed but depressed by my current events 
  
Yes Lord! 
  
Big Will swinging the best sword 
What''cha flexing for, don''t be testing me boy 
Messing with me boy, you''re stepping on the root of a daisy 
I have you''re girl saying 
  
Will why you do that to my baby? 
Yo Will, what they looking stupid in the face for? 
What? I can''t have rocks the size of a baseball 
Trust me when I cop I make sure mine cut glass 
Never spend my last, like a crack head for the blast 
Y''all can kiss my ass acting like you know me 
You ain''t got a Rolley, take this one here you owe me 
All in together now, wrists looking better now 
Screw greyhound bound, I''m getting cheddar now 
  
Burrrr! When she step up in the scene! 
Who! Ice gleam, y''all scream, "Bow to the Queen!" 
Ring on her finger mad phat 
Leonardo DiCaprio saw it and caught a flashback 
*mouth noise* 
All you rappers wanna snap, Jazzy Jeff got my back 
*mouth noise* 
Lil'' Kim bring it back, Lil'' Kim press the rack 
  
Yeah I''m short and sexy, my love''s divine 
My name is QB and I blow your mind with the 
*mouth noise* 
When I step up, body lookin'' hot 
All the music just stop
