 James Todd Smith, knowhatI'msayin? Trackmasters
 Fresh off the private jet from Europe - did four months out there
 Extra paper, scoop that up
 Back on the scene, crisp and clean
 You know how we get down baby, let me tell you a lil' story
 
 You're not a chickenhead goin "hee-shey"
 You're choosy in the bed like "hee-shey"
 I know your man's in the feds but "hee-shey"
 I can't figure out the reason you keep hawkin me
 Is it the.. invisible settings on the baguettes?
 The Benzes, Beamers and Corvettes?
 Or the.. wood-grain in the convertible Lex
 Be ease, shoppin sprees, what designer is next?
 Is it the.. Diablo, parked on Rodeo?
 Half a mill' in the trunk and I ain't moved no llello
 Could it be I'm.. anti-pimp, hundred-thousand a clip
 Hat low, doin donuts when I pull up out the dealership
 Is it the.. the Fortune 500 covers?
 The family man that got one baby mother?
 The way I brainwash y'all to love one another
 And got the whole community bouncin in unity
      (Born to love you baby) Why?
      (You know I love you baby) Why?
      (Kiss and hug you baby) Why?
      (I'll always love you baby) Why?

 Hmm.. you're not a chickenhead goin "hee-shey"
 You're choosy in the bed like "hee-shey"
 I know your man's in the feds but "hee-shey"
 I can't figure out the reason you be hawkin me
 Is it the.. twenty million I be grabbin a flick?
 Or my four-hundred million dollar FUBU clique?
 is it the.. "In the House" syndication chips
 Poppin two bottles, shorty read my lips
 They say Ladies, Love, Legend in Leather
 Simple ain't it... uh, but quite clever
 Is it the.. fact I melt in liquid ice?
 Tapped it once, you felt it twice
 Is it the.. multiple O's I'm known for those
 Temptation Island, wildin cause my neck froze
 Is it the.. bowlegged, hard-headed
 little honey in my grill with her pinkies wetted?
 Forget it
 Mmm.. you're not a chickenhead goin "hee-shey"
 You're choosy in the bed like "hee-shey"
 I know your man's in the feds but "hee-shey"
 I can't figure out the reason you keep hawkin me
 Is it the.. way I caress and hold you close?
 The iller, villa in Barbados?
 Is it the.. Countache rollin up to your door? Yeah
 Tell your roommate you ain't dancin no more, yeah
 Tell 'em your new man is cooler than before, yeah
 Tell 'em bout them twenty-thousand on tour, yeah
 Is it the.. the way that I defend your honor?
 Backhand your ex-man, tell him kill the drama?
 Is it the.. way the Mazerrati hug her body
 make you wanna be my next hottie, uh-huh
 From the bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
 Cruuuuuuuise.. it don't stop
 (Born to love you baby)
 (You know I love you baby)
 (Kiss and hug you baby)
 (I'll always love you baby)
