    Closer than my peeps you are to me, baby 
   Shorty, you’re my angel, you’re my darling angel 
   Girl, you’re my friend when I’m in need, lady 
        
 Life is one big party when you’re still young 
 But who’s gonna have your back when it’s all done 
  It’s all good when you’re little, you have pure fun 
  Can’t be a fool, son, what about the long run 
  Looking back Shorty always mention 
  Said me not giving her much attention 
  She was there through my incarceration 
  I wanna show the nation my appreciation 
 You’re a queen and so you should be treated 
 Though you never get the lovin’ that you needed 
 Could have left, but I called and you heeded 
 Takin’ a beatin’, mission completed 
 Mama said that I and I dissed the program 
 Not the type to mess around with her emotion 
 But the feeling that I have for you is so strong 
 Been together so long and this could never be wrong 
 Girl, in spite of my behavior, said I’m your savior 
  (You must be sent from up above) 
 And you appear to me so tender, say girl I surrender 
 (Thanks for giving me your love) 
 Girl, in spite of my behavior, well, you are my savior 
 And you appear to me so tender, well, girl I surrender 
 (Said thanks for giving me your love) 
 Now life is one big party when you’re still young 
 And who’s gonna have your back when it’s all done
