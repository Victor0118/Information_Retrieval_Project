 I've been thinking about you, my love
 And all the crazy shit you put me through
 Now I'm coming around, Throwing it back to you
 Were you thinking of me when you kissed him
 Could you taste me when you licked his skin
 All the while I showerd you with trust and promises

  What I'm needing now is some sweet revenge
  To get back all that I lost then
  I gave you all I had to give 
  But I could never reach you

   Adrienne, I thought I knew you
   Once again, you used me, used me
   Adrienne, I should have left you
   Long before you used me, Used me up
  
 Spent my money, drove my car
 I treated you like a shining star
 But in my sky all burnt out you are
 And I'll have the last laugh 
 When I see you walking with some other guy
 'Cause I know you're gonne end up all alone
 So take these words, some good advice
 All you've done's gonna come back twice
 You never cared how much it hurt 
 I really need to tell you

 You used me up
 

 Adrienne
 Long before
 Adreinne
 Adreinne,adreinne,adreinne…
