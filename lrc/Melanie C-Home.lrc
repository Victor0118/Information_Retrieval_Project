Once upon a time
Before all this mess began
I never felt alone
All now stolen

Simple and surreal
Was it a world of make-believe
You could take by the hand
And I'd follow

Hear my voice
Did you see me coming
I made the choice
Now I'm running
Turn me round
Let me go
Take me home

Never thought I'd see the day
When my life was not my own
I will throw it all away
Without sorrow

But it wouldn't change a thing
Wouldn't change the way I feel
For today is the price I pay
For tomorrow

Hear my voice
Did you see me coming
I made a choice
Now I'm running
Turn me round
Let me go
Take me home

Somehow suddenly
It slipped away from me
I reach out, hopelessly
You're gone

Hear my voice
Did you see me coming
I made a choice
Now I'm running
Turn me round
Let me go
Take me home

Hear my voice
Did you see me coming
I made a choice, but
Now I'm running
So turn me round
Let me go
Take me home
