 Whats The Story Morning Glory
 
 Don't Look Back In Anger
 
 
 Slip inside the eye of your mind
 Don't you know you might find
 A better place to play
 You said that you'd once never been
 All the things that you've seen
 Will slowly fade away
 
 So I start the revolution from my bed
 Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
 Step outside the summertime's in bloom
 Stand up beside the fireplace
 Take that look from off your face
 You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
 
 So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we're walking on by
 Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I hear you say
 
 Take me to the place where you go
 Where nobody knows if it's night or day
 Please don't put your life in the hands
 Of a Rock n Roll band
 Who'll throw it all away
 
 So I start the revolution from my bed
 Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
 Step outside the summertime's in bloom
 Stand up beside the fireplace
 Take that look from off your face
 You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
 
 So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we're walking on by
 Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I hear you say
 
 So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we're walking on by
 Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I hear you say
 
 So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we're walking on by
 Her soul slides away
 Don't look back in anger
 Don't look back in anger
 I heard you say
 At least not today
