 Was a sound of a crescendo
 He came into her apartment
 He left the bloodstains on the carpet
 She was sitting at the table
 He could see she was unable
 So she ran into the bedroom
 She was struck down
 It was her doom
 Annie, are you OK
 Are you OK
 Are you OK, Annie
 Annie, are you OK
 You OK
 Are you OK, Annie
 Annie, are you OK
 You OK
 You OK, Annie
 Annie, are you OK
 You OK
 Are you OK, Annie
 Annie, are you OK
 Will you tell us that you're OK
 There's a sign at the window
 That he struck you
 A crescendo, Annie
 He came into your apartment
 He left the bloodstains on the carpet
 Then you ran into the bedroom
 You were struck down
 It was your doom
 Annie, are you OK
 You OK
 Are you OK, Annie
 Annie, are you OK
 You OK
 Are you OK, Annie
 Annie, are you OK
 You OK
 Are you OK, Annie
 You've been hit by
 You've been struck by
 A smooth criminal
 So they came into the outway
 It was Sunday
 What a black day
 I could feel your salutation
 Sounding heartbeats
 Intimidations
 Annie, are you OK
 You OK
 Are you OK, Annie
 Annie, are you OK
 You OK
 Are you OK, Annie
 Annie, are you OK
 You OK
 Are you OK, Annie
 Annie, are you OK
 You OK
 Are you OK, Annie
 Annie, are you OK
 Will you tell us that you're OK
 There's a sign at the window
 That he struck you
 A crescendo, Annie
 He came into your apartment
 He left the bloodstains on the carpet
 Then you ran into the bedroom
 You were struck down
 It was your doom
 Annie, are you OK
 You OK
 Are you OK, Annie
 You've been hit by
 You've been struck by
 A smooth criminal
 Annie, are you OK
 Will you tell us that you're OK
 There's a sign at the window
 That he struck you
 A crescendo, Annie
 He came into your apartment
 He left the bloodstains on the carpet
 Then you ran into the bedroom
 You were struck down
 It was your doom
 Annie, are you OK
 You OK
 Are you OK, Annie
 Annie, are you OK
 You OK
 Are you OK, Annie
 Annie, are you OK
 You OK
 Are you OK, Annie
 Annie, are you OK
 You OK
 Are you OK, Annie
