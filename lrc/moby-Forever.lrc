 
 
 
 
 
 Forever
 Moby
 
 Two simple places
 We wanted to go
 Two simple things
 You wanted to know

 Everything around
 I could not see
 I wish I'd known
 How much you loved me

    Oh
    We could feel this way forever
  
 I watched the sun,
 cause it touches you while you sleep
 You gave me something,
 that I wanted to keep

 I see you smile you smile like a little child
 And hold you crying when it all goes wild

    Oh
    We could feel this way forever
