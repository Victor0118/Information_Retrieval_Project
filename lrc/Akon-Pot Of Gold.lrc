 Life come and go
 So let the history be told
 We're all out here
 Hustlin' to make our way
 And while you're stumblin' and fallin' (stumblin' and fallin')
 Why don't you pick yourself up now (pick yourself up now)
 You see we all out here
 Working day by day
 
 So tell me
 How can we work it out
 On that day when its time to share 
 the gold at the end of the rainbow
 How can we work it out
 When good and evil meet
 The day you kiss his feet
 Cause it will soon come
 
 You soon lose track of which way is up 
 when your always being put down (being put down)
 You gotta be strong and do what you feel in your heart
 Regardless of who's around (regardless of who's around)
 I know it might seem bold
 But thats all we have (all we have)
 Many centuries and we're steady gettin old
 But you know to what we never had
 
 Sooo
 How can we work it out
 On that day when its time to share 
 the gold at the end of the rainbow
 (how can we) How can we work it out (how can we)
 When good and evil meet
 The day you kiss his feet
 Cause it will soon come
 
 How can we work it out
 On that day when its time to share 
 the gold at the end of the rainbow (share the gold)
 How can we work it out
 When good and evil meet
 The day you kiss his feet
 Cause it will soon come
 
 How can we work it out (dada)
 Dodo (how can we work it out)
 How can we work it out (dada)
 Dodo ohhhh (dada)
 How can we work it out (dodo)
 Da da How can we work it out (dodo)
 (everybody sing along with me)
 
 How can we work it out
 On that day when its time to share 
 the gold at the end of the rainbow (that pot of gold)
 How can we work it out
 When good and evil meet
 The day you kiss his feet
 Cause it will soon come (yeah)
 
 How can we work it out
 On that day when its time to share
  the gold at the end of the rainbow (that pot of gold)
 How can we work it out
 When good and evil meet
 The day you kiss his feet
 Cause it will soon come (soon come)
 
 How can we work it out (work it out, work it out, work it out...)
