      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Farewell, December - Matt Nathanson . I like the way the streetlights fingerpaint your body. Fireworks off the roof glow in your eyes. Wearing my jacket, voice like an angel... hey, hey, hey. . I felt alive for the first time in my life. I held you tight and the crowd sang "Auld Lang Syne" Where Geary meets the sea, you turned and said to me, "This year was ours; farewell, December." . Ship lights look like stars out in the distance. We're as young now as we're ever gonna be. Your hand in my pocket, heart like a rocket... hey, hey, hey. . I felt alive for the first time in my life.  I held you tight and the crowd sang "Auld Lang Syne" The sky was turning blue, like movie endings do. This year was ours, ours, ours... farewell, December. . Faster, faster, slip this disaster. We go faster, faster, slip this disaster. We go faster, faster, slip this disaster. Faster, faster, lost in your laughter. . I felt alive for the first time in my life. I held you tight and the crowd sang "Auld Lang Syne" The sky was turning blue, like movie endings do. This year was ours, ours, ours... farewell, December. . Faster, faster, slip this disaster. Faster, faster, slip this disaster. Faster, faster, lost in your laughter. Faster, faster, slip this disaster. Faster, faster, lost in your laughter. . 歌词编辑：活在當下     QQ：6313827
