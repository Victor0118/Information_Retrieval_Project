 Weezer
 
 More and more I can't say no
 So afraid of letting go
 If there's something I can grab
 You can bet I'll pay the tab
 Counting all the flowers
 Waste the precious hours
 I need to find some peace
 
 All these problems on my mind
 Make it hard for me to think
 There is no way I can stop
 My poor brain is gonna pop
 And I don't have a purpose
 Scattered on the surface
 I need to find some peace
  Woah......
  
 And all the broken tethers
 We can bring together
   I need to find some peace
