 Sweet, succulent and fine
 A twinkling eye on my darling divine
 I love the way you move all the way you're designed
 Your only lines are my mind, forget the corny line
 Now let me hit you off with this question sign
 You seem to be the type for me to wine and dine
 A little candlelight dinner toasted over some wine
 Well, I will hit you off with this lyrical rhyme
 
 Now Mr. Lover keep her rockin', Mr. Lover keep her rockin'
 Mr. Lover keep her rockin' and swing
 Now Mr. Lover keep her rockin', Mr. Lover keep her rockin'
 Mr. Lover keep her rockin' and swing

 Step in my cara  of love
 So I can love, and give you hot oil rubs
 Dem ever wet kissies wit' dem brazen hugs
 And now your sweet, silky body on my Persian rug
 While we be sippin' cocoa from da same ol' mug
 I'm readin' fortune cookies from the Chines proverb
 It had some great stuff written in it with some cool rub-a-dub
 A little ol' reminisce in the hot tub, huh
 
 
 Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover
(Let's fog up some window sills, girl, uh)
