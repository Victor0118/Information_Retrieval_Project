 (la la la la la)
 Hey mama, this that sh*t that make you move, mama
 Get on the floor and move your booty moma
 We the blast masters blastin' up the jamma
 (REEEEEEEWIIIIIIND)
 Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
 Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
 Hey shorty, I know you wanna party
 the way your body look realli make me feel nauuughty
 Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
 Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
 Hey shorty, I know you wanna party
 the way your body look realli make me feel nauuughty
 
 I got a naughty naughty style and a naughty naughty crew
 But everything I do, I do just for you
 Im a little bit of Or, and a bigger bit of Nu
 The true n*ggers know that the peas come thru
 We never cease(NOO), we never die no we never disease(NOO)
 We multiply like we mathamatice
 Then we drop bombs like we in the middle east
 (The bomb bombas, the base move dramas)
 Naw y'all knaw, who we are
 y'all knaw, we the stars
 Steady rockin' on y'alls boulevards
 And, lookin' hot without bodygaurds
 (I do) what I can
 (Y'all come thru)will.i.am
 And still I stand, with still mic in hand
 (So come on mama, dance to the druma)
 
 Hey mama, this that sh*t that make you groove, mama
 (hey)get on the floor and move your booty mama
 (yaw)we the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
 (hey)so shake your bambama, come on now mama
 Hey mama, this that sh*t that make you groove, mama
 (hey)get on the floor and move your booty mama
 (yaw)we the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
 (la la la la la)
 
 We the big town stumpas, and and big sound pumpas
 The beat bump bumpas in your trunk trunkas
 The girlies in the club with the big plump plumpas
 And when I'm makin' love, my hip hump humps
 It never quits(NOOOO) we need to carry 9mm clips(NOOOO)
 Dont wanna squize trigger, just wanna squize t*ts
 (lubaluba)cause we the show stoppas
 And the chief rockas, number one chief rockas
 Naw y'all knaw, who we are
 y'all knaw, we the stars
 Steady rockin' on y'alls boulevards
 How we rockin' it girl, without body guards
 Now she be, its dirty, from the crew
 BET, come and take heed, as we take the lead
 (so come on bubba, dance to the druma)
 
 Hey mama, this that sh*t that make you groove, mama
 (yaw)get on the floor and move your booty mama
 (wuh)we the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
 (NAWWWW, NAWWW)
 Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
 Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
 Hey shorty, I know you wanna party
 the way your body look realli make me feel nauuughty
 
 But the race is not, for the swiss
 But who really can, take control of it
 And tippa irie and the black eyed peas will be thhhheeerre
 til infiniti, til infiniti, til infiniti, til infiniti
 Tippa is ouuuuuut
 
 Nosa dima shock, nosa dima ting
 everytime you sit there i hear, bling bling
 O wata ting, hear blacka sing
 grinding, and winding
 and the madda be moving in a perfect timing
 and we dance and dance to the end of the thing
 and we're really to nice, it finga akin
 like rice and peas and chicken and bling
 
 Hey mama, this that sh*t that make you groove, mama
 (hey)get on the floor and move your booty mama
 (yaw)we the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
 (hey)so shake your bambama, come on now mama
 Hey mama, this that sh*t that make you groove, mama
 (hey)get on the floor and move your booty mama
 (yaw)we the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
 (la la la la la  )
