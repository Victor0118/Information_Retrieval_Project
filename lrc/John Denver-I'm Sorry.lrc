 John Denver
 It's cold here in the city
 It always seems that way
 And I've been thinking about you almost everyday
 Thinking about the good times
 Thinking about the rain
 Thinking about how bad it feels alone again
 I'm sorry for the way things are in China
 I'm sorry things ain't what they used to be
  But more than anything else 
   I'm sorry for myself
 'Cause you're not here with me
 Our friends all ask about you
 I say you're doing fine
 And I expect to hear from you almost anytime
 But they all know I'm crying
 And I can't sleep at night
 They all know I'm dying down deep inside
 I'm sorry for all the lies I told you
 I'm sorry for the things I didn't say
 I can't believe you went away
 I'm sorry if I took some things for granted
 I'm sorry for the chains I put on you
 But more than anything else
 For living without you
