 When the last eagle flies
 Over the last crumbling mountain
 And the last lion roars
 At the last dusty fountain
 In the shadow of the forest
 Though she may be old and worn
 They will stare unbelieving
 At the Last Unicorn
 When the first breath of winter
 Throught the flowers is icing
 And you look to the north
 And a pale moon is rising
 And it seems like all is dying
 And would leave the world to mourn
 In the distance hear her laughter
 It's the Last Unicorn
 I'm alive....... I'm alive
 When the last moon is cast
 Over the last star of morning
 And the future has past
 Without even a last desparate warning
 Then look into the sky where through
 The cloudes a path is formed
 Look and see her how she sparkles
 It's the Last Unicorn
 I'm alive... I'm alive.
