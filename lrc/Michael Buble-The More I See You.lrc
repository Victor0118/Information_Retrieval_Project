 Michael Buble
 
  The more I see you
  The more I want you
  Somehow this feeling
  Just grows and grows
  
  With every sigh 
  I become more mad about you
  More lost without you
  And so it goes
  
  Can you imagine
  How much I love you
  The more I see you
  As years go by
  
  I know the only one for me 
  Can only be you
   My arms won't free you
   And my heart won't try
   
 THE END
