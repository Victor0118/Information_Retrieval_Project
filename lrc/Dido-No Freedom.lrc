     Dido - No Freedom Lyric by 听雨QQ:850454409 歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Taking by your silence  I'm free to walk out the door  By the look in your eyes I can tell  You don't think I'll be back for more  Try to think of a world  Where you could stay and these safe hands could go  Take your heart above the water  Wherever I chose to go  No love without freedom  No love without freedom  No love without freedom  No freedom without love  Even when you don't see me  Even when you don't hear  I'll be flying low below the sun  And you'll feel it all out here  No love without freedom  No love without freedom  No love without freedom  No freedom without love  No love without freedom  No love without freedom  No love without freedom  No freedom without love  Standing here in silence,  The world in front of me  Holding you in my hand  And seeing as you'd see  No love without freedom  No love without freedom  No love without freedom  No freedom without love  NO freedom without love
