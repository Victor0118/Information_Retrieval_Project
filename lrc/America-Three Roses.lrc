Sitting by the fireside with a book in your hand
Two lazy dogs sittin' watchin' your man
Three roses were bought with you in mind
Three roses were bought with you in mind

I gotta stop and see what I'm on about
Stop and feel what I want I gotta
Stop and see what I'm on about
Stop and feel what I want with you
Ah

Walking through a wonderland, I got you by the hand
Every move we made, just as if it were planned
Three roses were bought with you in mind
Three roses were bought with you in mind

I gotta stop and see what I'm on about
Stop and feel what I want I gotta
Stop and see what I'm on about
Stop and feel what I want with you
Ah
