 If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
 But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
 'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
 I'm so grateful and proud
 All I want is to sing it out loud
 So I say
 Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
 Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
 Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
 What would life be?
 Without a song or a dance what are we?
 So I say thank you for the music
 For giving it to me
 Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
 She says I began to sing long before I could talk
 And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
 Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
 Like a melody can?
 Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan
 So I say
 Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
 Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
 Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
 What would life be?
 Without a song or a dance what are we?
 So I say thank you for the music
 For giving it to me
 I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
 I wanna sing it out to everybody
 What a joy, what a life, what a chance!
 So I say
 Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
 Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
 Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
 What would life be?
 Without a song or a dance what are we?
 So I say thank you for the music
 For giving it to me
