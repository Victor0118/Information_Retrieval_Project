      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Martina McBride – A Great Disguise . People talking, think I'm all right Think I'm doing fine Goin' through the motions of my life Go to work now every mornin' Yeah I play the part And hide away the contents of my solemn heart . But when the sun goes down And the moon is high I can't control the flood of all these tears inside And if they only knew They'd be so surprised I'm just a good pretender in a great disguise . Keep 'em guessin', keep 'em laughin' Build that wall up high As long as they don't see the other side You've really done it Done a number, a number on my soul But I'll be damned if I'll ever let you know . But when the sun goes down And the moon is high There's no way to hide the truth from me, myself, and I Yeah, I wear it well Though it ain't my size I'm just a good pretender in a great disguise . I'm not one to show emotion Like some fools I see I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve I don't miss you Not for a moment I'm gonna be okay . Words of wisdom spoken By the light of day . But when the sun goes down And the moon is high Your memory pulls me under like a strong riptide I'm still in love with you It's all smoke and lights I'm just a good pretender in a great disguise I'm just a good pretender in a great disguise . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
