 
 
 
 Born down in a dead man's town
 The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
 You end up like a dog that's been beat too much
 Till you spend half your life just covering up
         Born in the U.S.A.
     I was born in the U.S.A.
 Got in a little hometown jam
 So they put a rifle in my hand
 Sent me off to a foreign land
 To go and kill the yellow man
 Come back home to the refinery
 Hiring man said "Son if it was up to me"
 Went down to see my V.A. man
 He said "Son, don't you understand"
 I had a brother at Khe Sahn
 Fighting off the Viet Cong
 They're still there, he's all gone
 He had a woman he loved in Saigon
 I got a picture of him in her arms now
 Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
 Out by the gas fires of the refinery
 I'm ten years burning down the road
 Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go
 I'm a long gone Daddy in the U.S.A.
 I'm a cool rocking Daddy in the U.S.A. now
