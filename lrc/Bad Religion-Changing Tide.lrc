      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Bad Religion - Changing Tide  Every day's the same routine of endless chores and boring details And you know you're waiting for the perfect condition for your ship to set sail  But you know the climate's always changing Clinging to the past has got you straining Comes the recognition now you're on a mission that is born to fail (Leave it!)  Brothers say goodbye Sisters don't you cry All embrace the times Wade into the changing tide  Searching for philosophy of life can be a drag on the soul Nowadays we pick and choose the pieces from other people's wisdom of old  But of course the climate's always changing Clinging to the past has got you straining Realizing all your most cherished beliefs are subject to rot and mold (Come on!)  Brothers say goodbye Sisters don't you cry All embrace the times Wade into the changing tide  歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
