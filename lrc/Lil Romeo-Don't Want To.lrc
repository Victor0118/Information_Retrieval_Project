 
Y'all don't really want to mess with me
Y'all better respect my G.
Better think before you step to me...
Where you from wodie?, I'm from the C-P-3
Y'all really down to ride with us
Cross side get wild with us
Get it crunk all the way live with us
From the South to the Eastside with us

 
Lets get it on I'm bad to the bone, edgin yo dome
What you know about a baby hummer sittin on chrome
Make moves like I'm grown with a style of my own
See the ice around my neck I go to school in a rover
Fifth grader seventy dollar phone two way pager
I'm a major, in other words I got flavor
I wreck mics rip shows and kick floors
Lil' Ro' got y'all throwin ya bows
I'm bout that if you hatin then stop that
Top that any club I rock that
Now rock that we takin our spot back
If you tryna stunt lil wodie I doubt that

 
Y'all don't really want to mess with me
Y'all better respect my G
Better think before you step to me...
Where you from wodie? I'm from the C-P-3
Y'all really down to ride with us

Call me the master I'm what you been missin
The one who be flippin I'm cool like that so I never be trippin
I'm that cool cat nice with the ball, nicer than y'all
You better take your points cause you might not score
I'm guaranteed M.V.P. hit jumpers and score
Somethin like Allen I. but I play like I'm tall
Corn raise starch glaise when I walk through the mall
Let my pants sag and always find time to talk to 'em all
I love movies buy a new CD every Tuesday
(??) that down south stuff groovy
Keys in my pocket so these skills gonna do me
I practice y'all I'ma do this thing truly

 
Y'all don't really want to mess with me
Y'all better respect my G
Better think before you step to me...
Where you from wodie? I'm from the C-P-3
Y'all really down to ride with us
Cross side get wild with us
Get it crunk all the way live with us

I'm the A I rock like a grown up on stage
I get e'm open leave e'm hoarse for days
Sound like a wild animal I need to be in a cage
I'm dangerous man in so many ways
I rip shows don't sleep shorty I'm woke
I been practicin since the age of four
I got my mind right I'm up in the limelight
I guess you hate me when you know that I rhyme tight
Nicer than nice I'm skillful make you think twice
Whats my name Lil' Ro, I'm larger than life
When I'm not pushin a hummer I'm ridin a bike
A Lil' Soulja what they call me I go off on the mic
If a ticket was around my neck it would be covered in ice
And my wrist stay blingin its a lovable site
I'm ragin on all types of stages
You might be nice but see I'm the greatest
Wanna see me take it home from the stages
I'm the one I'm tellin you son like the matrix
Matrix,matrix,matrix,matrix,matrix,matrix,matrix,matrix

 
Ya'll don't really want to mess with me
Y'all better respect my G.
Better think before you step to me...
Where you from wodie? I'm from the C-P-3
Y'all really down to ride with us
Cross side get wild with us
Get it crunk all the way live with us
From the South to the Eastside with us
