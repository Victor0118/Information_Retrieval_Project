     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Where You Stand - Travis BY:黄病病  Bumper car me left or right I’ll take a thousand knocks There’s a happy man in there And you won’t blink your eyes Like all the things you lost before i Right where you left me you know-oh Like all the things you found Mmm mmm Don’t taste them just swallow them whole  I forfeit my time And wait  While you make up your mind So tell me  If you ever find your flag  Cause I will be right by you where you stand  Lift me up or tear me down I’ll stand right up again There’s happy soul in there But you won’t let him in Like all the things we say before we Crumble and fall to the floor Like all the things we try Aye aye I know where it’s headed and so  I forfeit my time And wait while you re-make up your mind up So tell me  If you ever find your flag  Cause I will be right by you where you stand Oh I will be right by you where you stand I will deliver Where you stand I will not fall Where you stand there is no ocean Nor a river nor a shore  I fall into line  And wait while you make up your mind  So tell me if you ever find your flag  I forfeit my time And wait  While you make up your mind So tell me  If you ever find your flag  Cause I will be right by you where you stand Oh I will be right by you where you stand Oh I will be right by you where you stand   by:黄病病  END
