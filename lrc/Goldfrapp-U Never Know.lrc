 How long now
 I love you
 Steel painted eyes
 Feels like snow
 Change my head
 Days so long

 You never know 
 You never know
 You never know
 Just how long 
 It will be
 
  Here we go again
  We're going round and round
  Here we go again
  We're going round and round

 Today I know
 It's too long dare
 We'll see
 Feels like snow
 Chained myself to me
         How long now
    Longest story
