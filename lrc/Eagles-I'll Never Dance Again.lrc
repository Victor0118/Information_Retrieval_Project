 I'll Never Dance Again
 美国乡村音乐
 歌词:蒋大洋 
 My soul was a-swayin' to the beat of your heart
 And your lips were sayin' that we won't dance apart
 Now someone else is holding you the way I did the-eh-eh eh-en
 So I'll never, no I'll never, never dance again, oh no.
 I'll stay off the dance floor till memories grow di-i-i-i-m
 And my heart would break to see you take every step with him
 I'll survive seein' ya sighin' on that shoulder of his
 Oh how I've been cryin' knowin' how sweet that is
So while that guy is holding you the way I did the-eh-eh eh-en
 Oh I've danced with others just to show I don't care
 And my arms discovered that the thrill wasn't there
  Unless my arms are holding you the way I did the-eh-eh eh-en
 I will never, no no I'll never never dance again-oh I'll never
  Darlin' no I will never no no I'll never never dance again
 No, darlin' no I will never no no I'll never never dance again
 Say baby no I will never whoa-oh I'll never never dance again
Hey baby no I will never no-o-o-o-o-o-o-o I'll never never dance again
NO BABY NO I will never
