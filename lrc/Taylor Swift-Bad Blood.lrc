 You know it used to be mad love
 So take a look at what you've done
 Cause baby now we got bad blood
 Hey!
 Now we got problems
 And I don't think we can solve them
 You made a really deep cut
 And baby now we got bad blood
 Hey!
 Did you have to do this?
 I was thinking that you could be trusted
 Did you have to ruin what was shining, now it's all rusted
 Did you have to hit me where I'm weak baby, I couldn't breathe
 I rubbed it in so deep
 Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
 Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
 You and I
 Cause baby now we got bad blood
 You know it used to be mad love
 So take a look at what you've done
 Cause baby now we got bad blood
 Hey!
 Now we got problems
 And I don't think we can solve them
 You made a really deep cut
 And baby now we got bad blood
 Hey!
 Did you think we'd be fine?
 Still got scars on my back from your knife
 So don't think it's in the past
 These kind of wounds they last and they last
 Now did you think it all through?
 All these things will catch up to you
 And time can heal but this won't
 So if you come in my way, just don't
 Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
 You and I
 Cause baby now we got bad blood
 You know it used to be mad love
 So take a look at what you've done
 Cause baby now we got bad blood
 Hey!
 Now we got problems
 And I don't think we can solve them
 You made a really deep cut
 And baby now we got bad blood
 Hey!
 Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
 You say sorry just for show
 You live like that, you live with ghosts
 Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
 You say sorry just for show
 You live like that, you live with ghosts
 If you love like that blood runs bad
 Cause baby now we got bad blood
 You know it used to be mad love
 So take a look at what you've done
 Cause baby now we got bad blood
 Hey!
 Now we got problems
 And I don't think we can solve them
