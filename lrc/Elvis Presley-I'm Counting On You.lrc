      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com I'm Counting on You - Elvis Presley . All the words that I let her know Still could not say How much I need you so in every way . I hope you will guide me As only you can do Hold my hands down beside me I'm counting on you I'm counting on you dear From the dawn of each day . To always come through dear In your kind lovin' way If you knew just how deeply I feel things you do Then you know how completely I'm counting on you . I'm counting on you dear Around the dawn of each day To always come true, dear In your kind lovin' way If you knew just how deeply I feel things you do Then you know how completely I'm counting on you. . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
