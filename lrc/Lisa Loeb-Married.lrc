      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com You said there's something about the way he says your name when you're hanging, conversations in the front lounge you discuss your favorite movies he's never seen the Newsies, but you both love anything Stephen King . You see him watching from the corner of your eye he's always good at pretending he's preoccupied this is becoming so much more than you had planned you're only friends he swears it oh, you're just a lousy liar . He's married he's married you don't know what you're doing . You said he stares at you with the same eyes that squint in the sun and every morning he still wakes up beside her now some silly papers made a love that once burned wild into a joke that wasn't funny can't be funny when it hurts . He's married he's married you don't know what you're doing .  How are you supposed to heal this broken man, put him together, fix him right up you're such a tiny girl? you say he's always loving you so well but you can't be his yet . He's married he's married you don't know what you're doing
