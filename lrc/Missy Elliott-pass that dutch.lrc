 Symptoms have been said to be - heaving breathing
 Wild dancing, coughing

 If you's a fat one, put your clothes back on
 Before you start putting pot holes in my lawn
 Oh my God, show em I'm large
 Shove my beat up, attack like my name was Saddam

 And I can write a song sicker than Jeffrey Dahm'
