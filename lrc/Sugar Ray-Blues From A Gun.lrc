 Sugar Ray - Blues From A Gun    I want to watch the world cry  I couldn't open my eyes  I almost spoke but can't speak  Still being shelled all those lies  Blues from a gun  I'm not the only one  I've been fooled  They got me on the run  I've tried hard  Everything's been done  I've been fooled from blues from a gun    I start to watch the world crumble  I had to open my eyes  I start to run but I stumble  They stole the blue from the sky  Blues from a gun  I'm not the only one  I've been fooled  They got me on the run  I've tried hard  Everything's been done  I've been fooled from blues from a gun    Tears today in a way  Fears today won't go away  Blues from a gun  I'm not the only one  I've been fooled  They got me on the run  I've tried hard  Everything's been done  I've been fooled from blues from a gun    Whenever I turn around  I'm lost and I can't be found  Whenever I turn around  I'm lost and I can't be found  (Look at it fall)  All these graces flying in the end now  Look at it fall, look at it fall  All these graces flying in the end now  Look at it fall  Look at it fall  Look at it fall      END
