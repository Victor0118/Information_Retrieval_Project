Don't you ever go out
When was the last time you were out
Have you ever been out
Oh dear

Is something wrong with the air
Since you can't breathe in here
How long have you held your breath
Oh dear

What is closing you in
Must be a giant dream
It's not your life we have seen
Oh dear

Don't let your choices be
hopes you still can't feel
All was given for free
My dear
