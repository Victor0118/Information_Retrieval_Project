 This is the ultimate journey of your life
 Where the weak die and the strong survive
 Prepare to suffer 40 days and 40 nights
 Strap on your boots because you got a long hike
 
   Just another journey, another journey into time
 C'mon now
   Just another journey, who ever thought I'd cross this line
   Ohohohohoh
 
 Walking through the dirty streets of Jersey (Jersey)
 A dollar to my name searchin for that key
   I'm tryin not to reincorinate my past
   I'm tired from the game, took another path
 Destination 95 Dirty South
 Where the devil tried to realter my route
 Creator took me by the hand and led the way-ay
 to make the story short thats why I'm here today
  
 What about that day you said I would not --
 And about that day you kicked me out onto the bricks
 What about that time you said I wouldnt make a dime
 And about that time you said I couldn't make you mine
 Destination to the bank overseas
 Where Akons treated like royalty
 Cause there's so much in this world i have to see-e
 The wagon's rolling so jump in a follow me-e
 
 Born and raised in Africa trying to make a scene
 (trying to make a scene)
 The best way to get to you is by this music thing
 And you might believe
 
 Akon (Akon)
 C'mon (c'mon)
