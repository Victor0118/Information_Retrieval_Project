  Far beyond the desert road
  Where everything ends up
  So good the empty space, mental erase
  Forgive, forgot
  Heal them, like fire from a gun
  Kneeling, my god is the Sun
  Heal them, with fire from above
  Kneeling, my god is the Sun
  I dont know what time it was
  I dont wear a watch
  So good to be an ant who crawls
  Atop a spinning rock
  Heal them, like fire from a gun
  Kneeling, my god is the Sun
  Heal them, with fire from above
  Kneeling, my god is the Sun
  Heal them, like fire from a gun
  Kneeling, my god is the Sun
  Healing, kneeling
  Godless heathens
  Godless heathens always waltz on the sky...
