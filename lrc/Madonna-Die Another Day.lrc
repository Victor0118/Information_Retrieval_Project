 I'm gonna wake up -- yes and no
 I'm gonna kiss some part of
 I'm gonna keep this secret
 I'm gonna close my body now
 
  I guess I'll die another day
  I guess I'll die another day
  I guess I'll die another day
  I guess I'll die another day
 Sigmund Freud
 Analyze this
 Analyze this
 Analyze this
 
 I'm gonna break the cycle
 I'm gonna shake up the system
 I'm gonna destroy my ego
 I'm gonna close my body now
 
 I think I'll find another way
 There's so much more to know
 I guess I'll die another day
 It's not my time to go
 
 For every sin, I'll have to pay
 A time to work, a time to play
 I think I'll find another way
 It's not my time to go
 
 I'm gonna avoid the cliche
 I'm gonna suspend my senses
 I'm gonna delay my pleasure
 I'm gonna close my body now
 
 I guess I'll die another day
 I guess I'll die another day
 I guess I'll die another day
 I guess I'll die another day
 I think I'll find another way
 There's so much more to know
 I guess I'll die another day
 It's not my time to go
 
 I guess I'll die another day
 I guess I'll die another day
 I guess I'll die another day
 I guess I'll die another day
 
  Another day
  Another day
  Another day
 Another day
