     gordon's gardenparty the cardigans 歌词编辑：听雨 QQ：850454409 You in brown checked suit  said my dress was very cute  I found you found me  dancing in this melody  Heavenly!   We were swinging on so nice  bubbly pink champagne on ice  Nancy, Jacques Closeau and Claire  I believe they all were there  Having the time of their lives   You had Rose's lime  mixed with vodka, I had wine  People having fun  cocktails in the evening sun  Give me one!   We were swinging on so nice  bubbly pink champagne on ice  Nancy, Jacques Closeau and Claire  I believe they all were there  Having the time of their lives   We were swinging on so nice  bubbly pink champagne on ice  Nancy, Jacques Closeau and Claire  I believe they all were there  La la la do de do de do lyric by rain
