      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Island - Akon . Baby, I want you to know Your gone but I can't let, can't let you go Baby, I still love you so But I'm on this island alone . Lets get away Out to our island and needless to say I want to stay I know we'll be safe No one will find our own secret place Far and away . Baby I love you but something is wrong And I don't know if this is where we belong Another day, on our island. With tears on your face You sailed away . Baby, I want you to know Your gone but I can't let, can't let you go Baby, I still love you so But I'm on this island alone . Theres no escape From our island For me its too late Theres nothing but heartache And lonely days Wind and the shore is my only embrace As you sailed away . Baby I love you But something is wrong And can you forgive me if I don't come home? Another day on our island With tears on your face You sailed away . Baby, I want you to know Your gone but I can't let, can't let you go Baby, I still love you so But I'm on this island alone .  Baby, I want you to know Your gone but I can't let, can't let you go Baby, I still love you so But I'm on this island alone Baby, I want you to know Your gone but I can't let, can't let you go Baby, I still love you so But I'm on this island alone .
