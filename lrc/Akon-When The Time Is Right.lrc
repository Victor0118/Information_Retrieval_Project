 Yeah, what up, I go by the name of Divine
 I got my boy Akon in the back
 But before I bring him out
  I want all the ladies
 Come on, ok ok ok ok 
 Come on all my ladies in the place today
 Come on, ok ok ok ok
 Come on all my sexy ladies sing along with me (come on)
 
 Don't make me call the police
 It's a crime the way you bend them knees
 From the table to the floor
 spin it up and do it slow
 Give it up to all my niggas on the corners spending dough like
 Ain't nothing but money to me
 So sweet but you ain't nothing but hunnies to me
 Shorty get you sexy dere sipping on the cavasier
 Stylin up in the VIP, plannin to roll out with me
 Knowing that she's gonna come back
 As if shes up on my reindeer
 You know that she'll never wanna come back
 So I add her to my hall of fame here
 Bet your man can't do it like this (tell the truth girl)
 Bet your man can't do it like this (its all on you girl)
 
  (Come on), When the Time's Right
   I'd like to come over and get to kno ya
   Try to get closer, (Come on)
   When the Time's Right, I'd like to come over
   And work ya over, across your sofa
   Come on, Is it ok if I come over,
   Come on,That way I can get to kno ya, 
   Come on,Let me get a little closer, 
   Come on,Do you all over your sofa, Come on
   
 When I walk in the club with all the ladies so fly
 Gotta work that body so beautifully make you wanna cry
 That body could do whatever, thats no lie
 Gotta make it to gettin bigger makin me wanna slide
 Up under my apple tree, better yet you on top of me
 Switch it over let me bust all over you and not me
 Your so sexy, gotta punish you wit the first degree
 Ain't no stoppin the body rockin until we fall asleep
 
 I can tell by the way you act so hard you like my type of nigger
 Better bang in the back of the jeep and put a puncture in your liver
 I can tell by the way you act so soft you like my type of nigga
 Better get romantic with ya make love to ya by the river
 I'm wit the wine glass to go with your fine ass
 I could make that shine last if I make you mine fast
 Your the type I go all out to put you onto my staff
 Let me be your teacher baby girl cause you in the wrong class
 
 Owwwwh, When the Time's Right

  hey hey hey,Remember there is no rush girl
