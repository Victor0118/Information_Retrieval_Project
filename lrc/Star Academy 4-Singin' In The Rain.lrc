  I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
  What a glorious feelin', I'm happy again
  I'm laughin' at clouds so dark up above
  The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love
  
 Let the stormy clouds chase ev'ry one from the place
 Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
 I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain
 Just singin', singin in the rain
 
  ah ah ah I'm singin' in the rain
 
 
 
 END
