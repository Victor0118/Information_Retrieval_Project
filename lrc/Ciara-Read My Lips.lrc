So you’re stayin here tonight Everybody’s goin out Can we sit this one out, baby? I got something else in mind, close the blinds, dim the lights And you better bring your appetite I’ll make you something real nice If you like a lot of heat Better come up in my kitchen, baby Got everything that you like, why don’t you have a little taste? Don’t let nothing, don’t let nothing go to waste . Down down, but you gotta savor it, savor it I know it’s your favorite dish Top down, you better put yo feet up You ain’t leavin til you eat it all up .

On the kitchen floor, tonight you know it’s going down If you want some more baby you know I can throw it back Turn my oven on and it ain’t gon be no showin down This is how it’s going down, this is how it’s . You can call it good time, we ain’t gotta go out You got a home cooked meal right here Come on and take another bite, that’s right, that’s right Keep on going til you’re satisfied . It’s the best you ever had, once you taste a piece of that You can never go back baby, yea There’s nothing else like this around town Boy I got the sugar that can make you fall down . Down down, but you gotta savor it, savor it I know it’s your favorite dish Top down, you better put yo feet up You ain’t leavin til you eat it all up .
