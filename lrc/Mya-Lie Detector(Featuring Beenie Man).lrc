 This is for all y'all out there
 That ever dealt with somebody (Pump this in your jeeps)
 Who lyin' fakin' cheatin' 
 Stealin' creeping, B-Sin' (Pump this in your jeeps)
 I got this thing called the lie detector
 Two tea-spoons and they're bound to tell the truth 
 (Pump this in your jeeps)
 Listen
                 
 Mya-You told me, that I was your fantasy yeah
 You said that we would practice monogamy
 So I became a freak under the sheets
 Put his ass to sleep creeped into the kitchen
 And got the remedy it's called the lie detector
 I slipped it in his drink I brought it to his bedside
  And said take a sip of this and don't think
    You won't believe what happened 
   When he sipped the lie detector
  Looked into his eyes
  Asked him where you been?
  He said it's no surprise
  Cause I've been with my ex girl
  Why'd you tell me the truth?
  He said you wanted to hear the truth
   Sometimes I wish I never gave him a detector
  I thought he loved me but he loved her
  So I'm kind of glad he took the lie detector
  Now I know the truth so you can get the boot
 Beenie Man-Man you have to you have to you have to go mami
   Tie up tie up tie up clothes yeah
   End of end of end of the road
  Once you find out you gonna light up
 Mya-She told you 
 Baby let's get married
 Always been faithful 
 Let's spend eternity
 So he became a freak under the sheets
 Put her ass to sleep 
 Creep into the kitchen 
 Got the remedy 
 It's called the lie detector
 Slipped it in her drink 
 Brought it to her bedside
  Picked up the pager numbers
  Said who's called sixty-nine?
  She said don't be surprise
  Cause it's been your best friend
  He looked and swallow his pride
  Felt like crying, but guys don't cry
  But thought she loved him, but she loved his best friend
  But now he's kind of glad she took the lie detector
  He found out the truth so he gave her the boot
 Beenie Man-Now to all the women of the country
 It ain't my fault
 If the girl ain't want for love me
 Truly want to meet me
 Kind of girl that want to
 Too many girls they sugar
 They want to kiss me
 Anyway my life is sweet
 My girl is neat
 I know the streets
 Girls jumping at my feet
 Well my brides are few
 Oh I see we don't defeat
 From your lovin girl is but a treat
 Mya-(Beenie Man)
 If you got a need for some prescriptions 
 (Baby it's all up to your expectations)
 Make sure that it's with communication 
 (Look out for your man cause he put down the foundation)
 Don't want to find yourself asking how did this happen 
 (Ma just shows my love is not open)
 Friday the thirteenth went to the movies 
 (Baby hurry up and get goofy)
 When he gave the lie detector
 Sometimes he wished he never gave her a detector
 Beenie Man-Hey you have to you have to you have to go mami
 Once you find out,ya gonna light up
 You have to you have to you have to go mami
 Wyclef-New millenium
 R&B meets the Caribbean
 About to take over the world
