 Sugar Ray - In Through The Doggie Door    Well I just got back an hour ago  I don't know where I've been  Now I'm crawlin' across the kitchen floor  I don't know what I've seen  Well I feel so complicated  And our love is kinda jaded  Well I'm comin' through the doggy door again woo    Well there ain't no sence in comin' home  She knows where I've been  And it's another night out in the cold  One more time again  It's a hard time understandin'  You know you're so demanding  And I'm comin' through the doggy door again woo    I've got nothin' for ya  I've got nothin' for ya  I've got nothin' for ya baby  I've got nothin' for ya  I've got nothin' for ya    My life is complicated  Our love is kinda jaded  And I'm comin' through the doggy door  I'm runnin' through the doggy door  I'm fallin' through the doggy door again      END
