We'll fade out to whispers, It's the last days of summer in San Francisco. It's the last days of summer in San Francisco. . Love, no one cares about the stories they're not in. We'll fade out to whispers, It's the last days of summer in San Francisco. .  Last days of summer in San Francisco. . 歌词编辑：活在當下     QQ：6313827
