 Pink 
 
 I'm comin' up so you better get this party started 
 I'm comin' up so you better get this party started 
 
 Get this party started on a Saturday night 
 Everybody's waitin' for me to arrive 
 Sendin' out the message to all of my friends 
 We'll be lookin' flashy in my Mercedes Benz 
 I got lotsa style, got my gold diamond rings 
 I can go for miles if you know what I mean
 I'm comin' up so you better get this party started 
 I'm comin' up so you better get this party started 
 
 Pumpin up the volume, breakin down' to the beat 
 Cruisin' through the west side 
 We'll be checkin' the scene 
 Boulevard is freakin' as I'm comin' up fast 
 I'll be burnin' rubber, you'll be kissin' my ass
 Pull up to the bumper, get out of the car 
 License plate says Stunner #1 Superstar 
 I'm comin' up so you better get this party started 
 I'm comin' up so you better get this party started 
 Get this party started
 Makin' my connection as I enter the room 
 Everybody's chillin' as I set up the groove 
 Pumpin' up the volume with this brand new beat 
 Everybody's dancin' and their dancin' for me 
 I'm your operator, you can call anytime 
 I'll be your connection to the party line 
 I'm comin' up so you better get this party started 
 I'm comin' up so you better get this party started 
 I'm comin' up so you better get this party started 
 I'm comin' up so you betterget this party started
