 Oh my love my darling
 I've hunger for your touch
 A long lonely time
 And time goes by so slowly
 And time can do so much
 Are you still mine I...I need your love
 I...I need your love
 God speed your love to me
 lonely river flow to the sea to the sea
 To the open arms of the sea yeah
 lonely river sigh wait for me wait for me
 I'll be coming home wait for me
 Oh my love my darling
 I've hunger, hunger for your touch
 A long lonely time
 And time goes by so slowly
 And time can do so much
 Are you still mine
 I need your love
 I...I need your love
 God speed your love to me
