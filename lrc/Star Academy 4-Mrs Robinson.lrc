 And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
 Jesus loves you more than you will know
 God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
 Heaven holds a place for those who pray
 
 We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
 We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
 Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes
 Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home
 
 And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
 Jesus loves you more than you will know
 God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
 Heaven holds a place for those who pray
 
 Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
 Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
 It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair
 Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids
 
 Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs Robinson
 Jesus loves you more than you will know
 God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
 Heaven holds a place for those who pray
 
 Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
 Going to the candidates debate
 Laugh about it, shout about it
 When you've got to choose
 Ev'ry way you look at it, you lose
 
 Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio
 A nation turns its lonely eyes to you
 What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson
 Joltin' Joe has left and gone away
