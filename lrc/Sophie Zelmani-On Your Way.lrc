You never ask things you wonder.
You just wait until you wonder no more.
You're giving up so gently to get what your dreams are keeping you awake for.
Who hears your heart talking only ears that can do you no harm.
You only hear it if they listen.
You've changed your love you've changed your life you've changed your ways and that has taken you far taken you far.
Your eyes are constantly broken but your hands overwhelm a thousandfold.
So when are the things you're touching gonna be someone you can hold.
No need for love and you need no one.
You let them come so you can make them go.
It must be something you believe in somewhere your way is leading to is leading to.
