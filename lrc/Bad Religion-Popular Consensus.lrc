      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Bad Religion - Popular Consensus . Some people are almost impossible to live with Some people have faith in the craziest things They follow outdated conventions that were recorded But most of it to me all sounds insane . Maybe that's what you need to help you through the night Maybe you've seen the light But you know that popular consensus doesn't make it right . Nothing can go on while forever increasing The universe expanding is a different thing But to turn a nasty habit into a virtue Can't replace the need for charity . Maybe it's what you need to get you through the night Maybe you've seen the light But you know that popular consensus doesn't make it right . Like the seed of all creation or a doomsday scheme The future might be bright or bleak But you know that popular consensus doesn't mean much to me . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
