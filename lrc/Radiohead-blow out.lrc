 
 
 
 In my mind
 And nailed into my heels
 All the time
 Killing what I feel
  And everything I touch turns to stone
   All wrapped up in cotton wool,
   all wrapped up and sugar coated.
 I am fused
 Just in case I blow out
 I am glued
 Just in case I crack out
 And everything I touch
 turns to stone
 Everything I touch
 turns to stone
