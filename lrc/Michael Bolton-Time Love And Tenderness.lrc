 (Music)    
 So you say that you can't go on 
 Love left you cryin' 
 And you say all your hope is gone 
 And what's the use in tryin' 
 What you need is to have some faith 
 Shake off those sad blues 
 Get yourself a new view 
 Oh, nothing is a sad as it seems, you know 
 'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache 
 Someday, you'll laugh at the pain 
 Somehow you'll get through the heartache 
 Somehow you can get through the rain 
   When love puts you through the fire 
   When love puts you through the test 
   Nothing cures a broken heart 
   Like time, love and tenderness 
   When you think your world is over 
   Baby just remember this 
   Nothing heals a broken heart 
   Like time, love and tenderness 
  Time, love and tenderness 
 I understand how you're feeling now 
 And what you've been through 
 But your world's gonna turn around 
 So baby don't you be blue 
 All it takes is a little time 
 To make it better 
 The hurt won't last forever 
 Oh, all the tears are gonna dry you know 
 'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache 
 Someday you'll laugh at the pain 
 You may be down on your luck 
 But baby that old luck's gonna change 
 Baby, oh baby you just need some 
 You just need some 
 Time, love and tenderness 
 Time, love and tenderness 
 The hurt ain't gonna last forever 
 Time, love and tenderness 
 Baby, oh baby all you need 
 All you need is time, love and tenderness
