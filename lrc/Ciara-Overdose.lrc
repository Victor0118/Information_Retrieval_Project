      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Overdose - Ciara . You’re like a circus but you’re in my mind Got those with your eyes, what you tryna hide? You’re like a hurricane inside my veins But I like it baby, so bring on the break . Let me fall, let me fall, baby let me dream Can’t breathe, can’t breathe, getting loved tonight  Got my heartbeat pressing, that’s slowing down Got me sweating and I’m shaking, I’m freaking out . I took your love, think I took too much Somebody call the doctor Somebody call the doctor doctor  I took it all, but it’s not enough Somebody call the doctor Somebody call the doctor doctor  Don’t let don’t let don’t let don’t let go Don’t let don’t let don’t let don’t let go Hold me tight, I’m coming down I need your love and I need it now Don’t let don’t let don’t let don’t let go Don’t let don’t let don’t let don’t let go Somebody call the doctor before I overdose . I’m totally crazy, going back and forth Caught inside your storm But I want some more I hope your kisses and your gentle touch Come on, take me up ‘cause I need the rush . Let me fall, let me fall, baby let me dream Can’t breathe, can’t breathe, getting loved tonight  Got my heartbeat pressing, that’s slowing down Got me sweating and I’m shaking, I’m freaking out . I took your love, think I took too much Somebody call the doctor Somebody call the doctor doctor  I took it all, but it’s not enough Somebody call the doctor Somebody call the doctor doctor  Don’t let don’t let don’t let don’t let go Don’t let don’t let don’t let don’t let go Hold me tight, I’m coming down I need your love and I need it now Don’t let don’t let don’t let don’t let go Don’t let don’t let don’t let don’t let go Somebody call the doctor before I overdose . Don’t let me overdose, don’t let me overdose  Don’t let me overdose, don’t let me overdose . I took your love, think I took too much Somebody call the doctor Somebody call the doctor doctor  I took it all, but it’s not enough Somebody call the doctor Somebody call the doctor doctor  Don’t let don’t let don’t let don’t let go Don’t let don’t let don’t let don’t let go Hold me tight, I’m coming down I need your love and I need it now Don’t let don’t let don’t let don’t let go Don’t let don’t let don’t let don’t let go Somebody call the doctor before I overdose  . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
