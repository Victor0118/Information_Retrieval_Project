      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Too Many Friends - Placebo . My computer thinks I'm gay I threw that piece of junk away On the Champs-Elysées As I was walking home . This is my last communique Down the supper highway All that I have left to say in a single tome . I got too many friends Too many people that I'll never meet And I'll never be there for I'll never be there for 'Cause I'll never be there . If I could give it all away Will it come back to me someday? Like a needle in the hay or an expensive stone . But I got a reason to declaim The applications are to blame For all my sorrow and my pain A feeling so alone . I got too many friends Too many people that I'll never meet And I'll never be there for I'll never be there for 'Cause I'll never be there . Too many friends Too many people that I'll never meet And I'll never be there for I'll never be there for 'Cause I'll never be there . My computer thinks I'm gay What's the difference anyway When all the people do all day Is stare into a phone . I got too many friends Too many people that I'll never meet And I'll never be there for I'll never be there for 'Cause I'll never be there . Too many friends Too many people that I'll never meet And I'll never be there for I'll never be there for 'Cause I'll never be there . I'll never be there I'll never be there I'll never be there I'll never be there . 歌词编辑：活在當下     QQ：6313827
