 It's tricky when
 You feel that someone
 Has done something 
 On your behalf 
  
 It's slippery when 
 Your sense of justice 
 Murmurs underneath 
 And you're asking yourself
   How am I going to make it right?
 With a palm full of stars 
 I throw them like dice
    Repeatedly
 On the table 
 I shake them like dice
 And throw them on the table
 Until the desired constellation appears 
  How am I going to make it right?
