Not very often have we met  
　　But the music’s been too bad  
　　Can only sense happiness  
　　If the music is sad  
　　So， I’m going home  
　　I must hurry home  
　　Where a life goes on  
　　We’re too old to make a mess  
　　Dreams will keep me young  
　　Old enough to stress  
　　Only mirrors tell the time  
　　So， I’m going home  
　　I must hurry home  
　　So will my life go on?  
　　Yes， I’m going home  
　　Going home alone  
　　And your life goes on
