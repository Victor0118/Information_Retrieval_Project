     Roar Katy Perry ★Your lovin' POP -珂珂sheery lyrics-  I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath Scared to rock the boat and make a mess So I sat quietly, agreed politely I guess that I forgot I had a choice I let you push me past the breaking point I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything  You held me down, but I got up Already brushing off the dust You hear my voice, your hear that sound Like thunder, gonna shake your ground You held me down, but I got up Get ready cause I've had enough I see it all, I see it now  I got the eye of the tiger, the fire, dancing through the fire Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR Louder, louder than a lion Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR Oh oh oh oh oh oh You're gonna hear me roar  Now I'm floating like a butterfly Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes I went from zero, to my own hero You held me down, but I got up Already brushing off the dust You hear my voice, your hear that sound Like thunder, gonna shake your ground You held me down, but I got up Get ready 'cause I've had enough I see it all, I see it now  I got the eye of the tiger, the fire, dancing through the fire 'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR Louder, louder than a lion 'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR Oh oh oh oh oh oh You're gonna hear me roar  You're gonna hear me roar  Roar-or, roar-or, roar-or  I got the eye of the tiger, the fire, dancing through the fire 'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR Louder, louder than a lion 'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me ROAR Oh oh oh oh oh oh You're gonna hear me roar  You're gonna hear me roar  ◎Lrc By www.lrcgc.com 珂珂sheery◎
