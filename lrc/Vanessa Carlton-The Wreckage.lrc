 Album: Harmonium
    
  Speeding into the horizon
  Dreaming of the sirens
  Wishing for broken glass on a highway
  It could be so easy
 The rhythm, the rhythm of an engine
 Always makes me empty
 I see the headlights coming at me
 I can't help but wonder
 Flying, flying in slow motion
 The wind through my hair
 And ripping through the scenery
 Oh, the wreckage
 It is my secret need
 Ahhh... Ahhh...
 END
