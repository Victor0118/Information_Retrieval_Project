 演唱：Avril Lavigne
 
 First glance
 You nearly made my jaw drop
 First dance
 And you were looking so hot
 Held hands
 And moved in for a lip lock
 Don't stop baby
 Don't stop baby
 
 First taste, like honey
 You were so yum
 Can't wait for a second
 'Cause it's so fun
 Third base
 And head it for a homerun
 Don't stop baby
 Don't stop baby
 Now hold on tight
 To this roallercoster ride
 
 And if you're lovin' this
 Just give me one more kiss
 'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
 
 And just let go
 If you don't we'll never know
 
 So if you're lovin' this
 Just give me one more kiss
 'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
 
 My place, you showed up with flowers
 
 Your face, could stare at it for hours
 Can't wait to see your super powers
 Don't stop baby
 Don't stop baby
 
 Your car, I'm sitting right beside you
 
 A rock star at everything that you do
 My heart is ready for the next move
 Don't stop baby
 Don't stop baby
 
 Now hold on tight
 To this roallercoster ride
 
 And if you're lovin' this
 Just give me one more kiss
 'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
 
 And just let go
 
 If you don't we'll never know
 
 So if you're lovin' this
 Just give me one more kiss
 'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
 
 Yeah yeah, not yet
 Yeah yeah, not yet
 Yeah yeah, not yet
 
 'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
 
 Hold on, hold on
 
 Hold on, hold on tight
 
 Hold on tight
 
 To this roallercoster ride
 
 And if you're lovin' this
 Just give me one more kiss
 'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
 
 And just let go
 If you don't we'll never know
 
 So if you're lovin' this
 Just give me one more kiss
 'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
 
 Yeah yeah, not yet
 Yeah yeah, not yet
 Yeah yeah, not yet
 'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
 Yeah yeah, not yet
 Yeah yeah, not yet
 Yeah yeah, not yet
 'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
