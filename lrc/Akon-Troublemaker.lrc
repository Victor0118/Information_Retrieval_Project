 All steady up in the club, just swagging doing my thang
 Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
 Partying so hard, the ladies don’t want it to end
 They looked at me and said, “I heard that you’re a heartbraker”
 Baby I’m a troublemaker, I heard that you’re a heartbraker
 Baby I’m a troublemaker, I heard that you’re a heartbraker
 Baby I’m a troublemaker, I heard that you’re a heartbraker
 Baby I’m a troublemaker
 See, I’m that type of guy you won’t love
 I’m that type of guy you won’t cuff
 I’m that type of guy you daddy won’t let go out, 
 cause he thinks I sell drugs
 I’m that type of guy that will save ya
 I’m that type that will call you later
 Won’t be around to give you that time
 Gotta get on the grind and get to that paper
 That I can do
 Gotta keep my baby girl laced in the latest and the fliest suits
 Never one for none, let’s get cake up, hold it down, that’s all you gotta do
 Then I walk up in the place, with a pocket full of money, my brother like ???
 Stepping out with the finest suits, look at me now
 All steady up in the club, just swagging doing my thang
 Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
 Partying so hard, the ladies don’t want it to end
 They looked at me and said, “I heard that you’re a heartbraker”
 Baby I’m a troublemaker, I heard that you’re a heartbraker
 Baby I’m a troublemaker, I heard that you’re a heartbraker
 Baby I’m a troublemaker, I heard that you’re a heartbraker
 Baby I’m a troublemaker
 See I’m that type guy that likes kissing
 I’m that type that will pop the clip and
 I’m that type of guy that put you in your place
 If you ??? just start tripping
 I’m that type that will let you go
 I’m that type that will let you know
 That everywhere I go, I can find a pretty hoe
 But there ain’t too many know how to get that dough
 That’s the type of girl I want around me
 Even though I’m a with her, make a man feel free
 Roll with the fellas, even hold my cheese
 Look like something you would see on TV
 She don’t mind climbing up that ladder
 Similar to the words, it don’t matter
 But this time they wanna see us together
 Look at us now
 All steady up in the club, just swagging doing my thang
 Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
 Partying so hard, the ladies don’t want it to end
 They looked at me and said, “I heard that you’re a heartbraker”
 Baby I’m a troublemaker, I heard that you’re a heartbraker
 Baby I’m a troublemaker, I heard that you’re a heartbraker
 Baby I’m a troublemaker, I heard that you’re a heartbraker
 Baby I’m a troublemaker
 You’re not for sure
 Even though I wanna take you everywhere I go
 Because of you, all the girls is staring, taking notes
 And I realize between with you girl brings more girls
 And that’s just what I’m attracted to
 And I’d rather go all the way
 Love her long time, till the break of day
 I won’t let her leave my bed
 Till she sees the colorful feather like Annie Mae
 Now she wants to start holding on me, like whatever she’s smoking on
 I’ll be long gone before you can say, “look at me now”
 All steady up in the club, just swagging doing my thang
 Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
 Partying so hard, the ladies don’t want it to end
 They looked at me and said, “I heard that you’re a heartbraker”
 Baby I’m a troublemaker, I heard that you’re a heartbraker
 Baby I’m a troublemaker, I heard that you’re a heartbraker
 Baby I’m a troublemaker, I heard that you’re a heartbraker
 Baby I’m a troublemaker
