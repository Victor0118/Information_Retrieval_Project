      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Homecoming Queen - Sheryl Crow . 28, shouldn’t look this old But the last ten years sure took their toll On the girl in the picture with the plastic crown That sea queen dress wouldn’t fit her now Like it did Before the kids . Yea she loves her husband ‘cause she said she would Oh it ain’t so good but it ain’t so good She swore she wouldn’t get stuck in this town Now she’s cutting coupons two doors down From a mall And it goes on . Yea too bad love ain’t a local parade In your uncle’s Corvette on a Saturday With all the little girls waiting on you to wave When you’re 17 You don’t know That you won’t always be Homecoming queen . Newspaper clipping and a stash in a box Are the only things that didn’t get lost She married a guy on the real estate sign And it’s hard to believe once upon a time She was royalty The girl we all wanted to be . Yea too bad love ain’t a local parade In your uncle’s Corvette on a Saturday With all the little girls waiting on you to wave When you’re 17 You don’t know That you won’t always be Homecoming queen . Or the captain of the team And it ain’t what it seems It’s just a teenage dream . Too bad love ain’t a local parade In your uncle’s Corvette on a Saturday With all the little girls waiting on you to wave When you’re 17 You don’t know You won’t always be You don’t know You won’t always be Homecoming queen . 歌词编辑：活在當下     QQ：6313827
