     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Aim For Me(LP Version) - Sugar Ray Aim for me Aim for me  Aim for me Aim for me (Hit it) It's a great big world And you don't believe in nothin' Don't believe in nothin' anyway So we got a lot to learn But we started out with nothin' With my friends we're going on our way  Some people change An' your life will rearrange Even when you're so far from home  When it's said and done And you got yourself a run That's okay we'll never come undone  Aim for me Aim for me  Aim for me  Aim for me Yeah! They'll try to count you out But you gotta count yourself in There's no time to throw it all away  Now I'm tellin' that I'm rushing See the trouble that we've been in Didn't ask for nothing along the way  When it's said and done And you got yourself a run That's okay we'll never come undone  Some people change An' your life will rearrange Even when you're so far from home Aim for me Aim for me  Aim for me  Aim for me  Yeah! Oh my God I, I  Hit man  Some people change An' your life will rearrange Even when you're so far from home  When it's said and done And you got yourself a run That's okay we'll never come undone Aim for me  Aim for me Aim for me  Aim for me  Aim for me Some people change Your life will rearrange  Even when you're so far from home  陈先生 QQ：1552195557
