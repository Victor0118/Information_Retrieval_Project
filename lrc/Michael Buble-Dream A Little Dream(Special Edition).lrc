 Michael Buble
 
 Stars shining bright above you, 
 Night breezes seem to whisper, "I love you".
 Birds singing in the sycamore tree 
 Dream a little dream of me.
 Say "nighty-night" and kiss me. 
 Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me.
 While I'm alone and blue as can be
 Dream a little dream of me.
 
 Stars fading, but I linger on, dear.
 Still craving your kiss
 I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear.
 Just saying this: 
 Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you.
 Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you.
 But in your dreams whatever they be
 Dream a little dream of me.
 
 Stars fading, but I linger on, dear.
 Still craving your kiss, 
 I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear.
 Just saying this: 
 Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you.
 Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you.
 But in your dreams whatever they be 
 Dream a little dream of 
 Dream a little dream of
 Dream a little dream of me.
 
 Dream a little dream of me.
