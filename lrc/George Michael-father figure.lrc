 Something special, something sacred
 In your eyes
 For just one moment
 To be bold and naked
 At your side
 Sometimes I think that you'll never
 Understand me
 Maybe this time is forever
 Say it can be
 That's all you wanted
 Something special, someone sacred
 In your life
 Just for one moment
 To be warm and naked
 At my side
 Sometimes I think that you'll never
 Understand me
 But something tells me together
 We'd be happy
 (Baby)
 I will be your father figure
 (Oh baby)
 Put your tiny hand in mine
 (I'd love to)
 I will be your preacher teacher
 (Be your daddy)
 Anything you have in mind
 (It would make me)
 I will be your father figure
 (Very happy)
 I have had enough of crime
 (Please let me)
 I will be the one who loves you
 Until the end of time
 That's all I wanted
 But sometimes love can be mistaken
 For a crime
 That's all I wanted
 Just to see my baby's
 Blue eyed shine
 This time I think that my lover
 Understands me
 If we have faith in each other
 Then we can be
 Strong
 I will be your father figure
 Put your tiny hand in mine
 I will be your preacher teacher
 Anything you have in mind
 I will be your father figure
 I have had enough of crime
 I will be the one who loves you
 Until the end of time
 If you are the desert
 I'll be the sea
 If you ever hunger
 Hunger for me
 Whatever you ask for
 That's what I'll be
 So when you remember the ones who have lied
 Who said that they cared
 But then laughed as you cried
 Beautiful Darling
 Don't think of me
 Because all I ever wanted
 It's in your eyes baby, baby
 And love can't lie, no...
 (Greet me with the eyes of a child)
 My love is always telling me so
 (Heaven is a kiss and a smile)
 Just hold on, hold on
 I won't let you go, my baby
 I will be your father figure
 Put your tiny hand in mine
 I will be your preacher teacher
 Anything you have in mind
 I will be your father figure
 I have had enough of crime
 (So I am gonna love you)
 Until the end of time
 I will be your father
 I will be your preacher
 I will be your daddy
 I will be the one who loves you until the end of time
