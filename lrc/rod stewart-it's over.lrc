     it's over rod stewart 歌词编辑：听雨 QQ：850454409 The congregation sang  We knelt and prayed  As we stood before God  On that beautiful day  The church bells rang  And the champagne flowed  As our friends gather round  For the wedding photo  But here we are barely five years on  An’ our whole world’s fallin’ apart   All the plans we had together  Up in smoke and gone for ever  Poisoned by the lawyer’s letter  It’s over  I don’t want our kids to suffer  Can we talk to one another  You were once my light, my lover  It’s over  Rumours and whispers tear me apart  That I know you better than that   Inseparable were we  With a breeze in our sails  Now I feel a chill wind  On the marriage that failed  And our friends are divided  They’ve taken their sides  Now they’ll all sit back  And watch the circus arrive  I don’t stand here tryin’ to focus the blame  But I’m hurtin’ deep down in inside   All the pain an’ all the grievin’ When did we stop believin’ Too late now to stop the bleedin’ It’s over  What’s the sense in pointin’ fingers  Who’s the saint an’ who’s the sinner  They’re ain’t gonna be a winner  It’s over  Oh, my dear, what happened to us?  Tell me, where did it all go wrong?   What’s the use in keep on fightin’? All the tears, all the cryin’ Why do we keep denyin’? It’s over  In all the time I thought I knew ya  Don’t forget our children’s future  I would do whatever suits ya  Oh ye-ah!  It’s over  It’s over  Yeah, it’s over lyric by rain
