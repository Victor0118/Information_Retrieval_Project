 I will not give you up
 Gotta have some faith in the sound
 It's the one good thing that I've got
 I won't let you down
 So please don't give me up
 Because I would really, really love to stick around
 Heaven knows I was just a young boy
 Didn't know what I wanted to be
 I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
 And I guess it was enough for me
 To win the race? A prettier face!
 Brand new clothes and a big fat place
 On your rock and roll TV
 But today the way I play the game is not the same
 No way
 Think I'm gonna get me some happy
 I think there's something you should know
 I think it's time I told you so
 There's something deep inside of me
 There's someone else I've got to be
 Take back your picture in a frame
 Take back your singing in the rain
 I just hope you understand
 Sometimes the clothes do not make the man
 All we have to do now
 Is take these lies and make them true somehow
 All we have to see
 Is that I don't belong to you
 And you don't belong to me
 Freedom
 You've gotta give for what you take
 Freedom
 You've gotta give for what you take
 Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy
 What a kick just a buddy and me
 We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy
 We were living in a fantasy
 We won the race
 Got out of the place
 I went back home got a brand new face
 For the boys on MTV
 But today the way I play the game has got to change
 Oh yeah
 Now I'm gonna get myself happy
 I think there's something you should know
 I think it's time I stopped the show
 There's something deep inside of me
 There's someone I forgot to be
 Take back your picture in a frame
 Don't think that I'll be back again
 I just hope you understand
 Sometimes the clothes do not make the man
 All we have to do now
 Is take these lies and make them true somehow
 All we have to see
 Is that I don't belong to you
 And you don't belong to me
 Freedom
 You've gotta give for what you take
 Freedom
 You've gotta give for what you take
