 Where do we go, nobody knows
 I've got to say, I'm on my way down
 God give me style and give me grace
 God put a smile upon my face
 
 Where do we go to draw the line?
 I've got to say, I wasted all your time, oh honey honey
 Where do I go to fall from grace?
 God put a smile upon your face, yeah
 
 Now, when you work it out I'm worse than you
 Yeah, when you work it out I want it too
 Now, when you work out where to draw the line
 Your guess is as good as mine
 
 Where do we go, nobody knows
 Don't ever say you're on your way down
 When God gave you style and gave you grace
 And put a smile upon your face, oh yeah
 
 Now, when you work it out I'm worse than you
 Yeah, when you work it out I want it too
 Now, when you work out where to draw the line
 Your guess is as good as mine
 
   It's as good as mine
    It's good as mine
 
 Where do we go, nobody knows
 Don't ever say you're on your way down
 When God gave you style and gave you grace
 And put a smile upon your face.
