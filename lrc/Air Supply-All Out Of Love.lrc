Air Supply 
 I’m lying alone with my head on the phone
 Thinking of you till it hurts
 I know you hurt too but what else can we do
 Tormented and torn apart
 I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
 For times when my life seems so low
 It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
 When today doesn’t really know
 Doesn’t really know
(Chorus) 
     I’m all out of love, I’m so lost without you
     I know you were right believing for so long
     I’m all out of love, what am I without you
   I can’t be too late to say that I was so wrong
  I can’t be too late I know I was so wrong
 happy days to everybody

 I want you to come back and carry me home
 Away from these long lonely nights
 I’m reaching for you, are you feeling it too? 
 Does the feeling seem oh so right? 
 And what would you say if I called on you now
 And said that I can’t hold on
 There’s no easy way it gets harder each day
 Please love me or I’ll be gone, 
 I’ll be gone
(Chorus) 
 Ooh what are you thinking of
 What are you thinking of
 What are you thinking of
 What are you thinking of
