     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Bethlehem(LP Version) - Chicago With this Frankincense And this Gold and Myrrh We are traveling so far For a vision of one child Born of love We are following this star  So, the three of us travel 'Round the world We are riding toward one dream  In the darkest night We see heaven's light Shining on the new born king What's that star that's shining Oh, so bright What's this road That we must follow Why this little town These three men, so wise Who's this child That we must follow  Here to Bethlehem  There's a song to sing And a tale to tell And a world to rise above  So, we're traveling here to Israel Just to find this child of love  What's that star that's shining Oh, so bright What's this road That we must follow  Why this little town These three men, so wise Who's this child That we must follow Here to Bethlehem  What's that star that's shining Oh, so bright What's this road That we must follow Why this little town These three men, so wise Who's this child That we must follow  Here to Bethlehem  Here to Bethlehem 陈先生 QQ：1552195557
