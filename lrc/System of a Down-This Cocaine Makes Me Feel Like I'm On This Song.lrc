 There's nothing wrong with me
 There's something wrong with you
 There's something wrong with me
 I hope your stepson doesn't eat the fish
 When we're crying for our next fix
 There's nothing wrong with me
 There's something wrong with you
 There's something wrong with me
 I hope your stepson doesn't eat the fish
 When we're crying for our next fix
 Killers never hurt feelings
 Killers never hurt feelings
 Killers never hurt feelings
 
 Gonorrhea gorgonzola
 Gonorrhea gorgonzola
 Single files of clean feedings
 
 I can't see your souls,
 souls through through your eyes
 The crying walls of sliding architecture
 Kidnapped by the likes of pure conjecture
 Upholstery loving men all dwelling in the wells
 Kidnapped by the likes of pure conjecture
 
 Killers never hurt feelings
 Killers never hurt feelings
 Killers never hurt feelings

 There's nothing wrong with me
 There's something wrong with you
 Wrong with you and I
 When we're crying for our next fix
 There's nothing wrong with me
 There's something wrong with you
 Wrong with you and I
 When we're crying for our next fix
 Killers never hurt feelings
 Killers never hurt feelings
 Killers never hurt feelings

 There's nothing wrong with me
 There's something wrong with you
 There's something wrong with me
 I hope your stepson doesn't eat the fish
 There's nothing wrong with me
 There's something wrong with you
 
 Don't eat the fish
