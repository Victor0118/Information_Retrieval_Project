     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Doin' Business(Remastered LP Version) - Chicago Tired of riding freeways  Tired, so tired of fighting the crowd  Repetition, ecstatic trips flow  I'm tired of my best friends  Tired of feeling used  Talkin' small talk, movin' slow  Tired of feeling guilty  I'm tired, I'm tired of standing still  I had big dreams, where'd they go? Tell me, where did my dreams go?  Doin' business, dressed in gray  Try to make it, payday to payday  Doin' business, here to stay  I'm tired of the program  Tired, tired of playing the game  Television, radio Tell me, where did the dreams go? Doin' business, in control  Life on a schedule, heart and soul  Doin' business, it's to go  陈先生 QQ：1552195557
