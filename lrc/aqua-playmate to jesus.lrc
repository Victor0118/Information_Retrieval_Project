     playmate to jesus aqua 歌词编辑：听雨 QQ：850454409 Come here  Let me take you on a trip  Leaving in the name of love  Silence and emptiness   You're among a billion stars  Please don't say a single word  All around the galaxy  Silence and emptiness   Let's go into space  Heading for Venus  Fly around the Sun  Playmate to Jesus  Everywhere I go, I pray  For universal love   High above the sky  Closer to Heaven  Here among the stars  All is forgiven  Everywhere I go, I pray  For universal love   I'm hearing nothing - is it me or is it you?  I keep on trying but you're just not coming through  I see your signal but I keep on losing it  I'll find your frequency bit by bit   Forgive me  Please, forgive the things I've done  Every little matters here  Life keeps moving on   Everlasting energy  Shining all over me  Falling into gravity  Silence and emptiness   Let's go into space  Heading for Venus  Fly around the Sun  Playmate to Jesus  Everywhere I go, I pray  For universal love   High above the sky  Closer to Heaven  Here among the stars  All is forgiven  Everywhere I go, I pray  For universal love   (Can you hear me?) I'm hearing nothing - is it me or is it you?  (Can you hear me?) I keep on trying but you're just not coming through  (Can you hear me?) I see your signal but I keep on losing it  (Can you hear me?) I'll find your frequency bit by bit   Love spreads love - forevermore  Fear spreads fear - the Devil's core  Take my hand and follow me  It's magical   This moment's gonna change my life   (Can you hear me?) Love spreads love - forevermore  (Can you hear me?) Fear spreads fear - the Devil's core  (Can you hear me?) Take my hand and follow me  (Can you hear me?) It's magical - so here we go   Let's go into space  Heading for Venus  Fly around the Sun  Playmate to Jesus  Everywhere I go, I pray  For universal love   High above the sky  Closer to Heaven  Here among the stars  All is forgiven  Everywhere I go, I pray  For universal love   (Can you hear me?) I'm hearing nothing - is it me or is it you?  (Can you hear me?) I keep on trying but you're just not coming through  (Can you hear me?) I see your signal but I keep on losing it  (Can you hear me?) I'll find your frequency bit by bit   word by rain
