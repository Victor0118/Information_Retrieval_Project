 Walking like a man,
 hitting like a hammer, she's a juvenile scam.
 Never was a quitter,
 tasty like a raindrop,
 she's got the look.
 
 Heavenly bound cause heaven's got a number when she's spinning me around,
 kissing is a colour.
 Her loving is a wild dog,
 she's got the look.
 
 She's got the look.
 She's got the look.
 She's got the look.
 She's got the look.
 What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue.
 
 When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you
 
 and I go: la la la la la she's got the look.
 
 Fire in the ice naked to the t-bone is a lover's disguise.
 Banging on the head drum, shaking like a mad bull,
 she's got the look.
 
 Swaying to the band, moving like a hammer she's a miracle man.
 Loving is the ocean, kissing is the wet sand,
 she's got the look.
 
 She's got the look.
 She's got the look.
 She's got the look.
 She's got the look.
 What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue.
 
 When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you
 
 and I go: la la la la la she's got the look.
 
 Walking like a man,
 hitting like a hammer, she's a juvenile scam.
 Never was a quitter,
 tasty like a raindrop,
 she's got the look.
 
 And she goes: na na na na na na....
 She's got the look.
 
 She's got the look.
 She's got the look.
 She's got the look.
 She's got the look.
 What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue.
 
 When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you
 
 and I go: la la la la la she's got the look.
 
 What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue.
 
 When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you
 
 and I go: la la la la la
 
 na na na na na na na na...
 She's got the look
 
 and she goes: na na na na na na...
 She's got the look
 She's got the look
 and she goes: na na na na na na...
 She's got the look
 She's got the look
 and she goes: na na na na na na...
 She's got the look
 She's got the look
