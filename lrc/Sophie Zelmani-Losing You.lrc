I can tell 
by your look
There's something missing
something I took

I can tell 
by the way you sound
Won't be long 
you won't be around

Oh I'm losing you
Oh I'm losing you

Was it my words
or my silence
I know it hurts
my kind of violence

Won't you tell 
how I hurt you
Won't be long 
you won't be around

Oh I'm losing you
Oh I'm losing you
