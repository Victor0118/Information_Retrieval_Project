 制作:LRC歌词网
 
 Stars shining bright above you 
 Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you" 
 Birds singin' in the sycamore trees 
 Dream a little dream of me
 Say nighty-night and kiss me 
 Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me 
 While I'm alone and blue as can be 
 Dream a little dream of me 
  Stars fading but I linger on dear 
  Still craving your kiss 
  I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear 
  Just saying this 
  Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you 
  Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you 
  But in your dreams whatever they be 
  Dream a little dream of me
