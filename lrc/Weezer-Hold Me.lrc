 Weezer
 
 I am terrified of all things.
 Frightened of the dark.
 I am.
 You are taller than a mountain.
 Deeper than the sea.
 You are.

     Hold me.
     Hold me.
    Take me with you 'cause I'm lonely.
 
 I was closer to you back then.
 I was happier.
 I was.
 You are fading further from me.
 Why don't you come home to me?
 
  I am...
 Cold.
 Hold Me.
