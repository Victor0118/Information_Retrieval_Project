 Gotta find your inner strength
 If you can't then just throw life away
 Gotta learn to rely on you
 Beauty, strength, and wisdom,too
 You're beautiful inside and out
 Lead a great life without a doubt
 Don't need a man to make things fair
 "Cuz more then likely he won't be there
 Listen girl, gotta know it's true
 In the end all you've got is you
 
 END
