 It's for the ghetto..
 For the ghetto (uh) for the ghetto (yeah)
 It's for the ghetto (uh) man it's for the ghetto (yeah)
 It's for the ghetto (uh) it's for the ghetto (yeah)
 It's for the ghetto (uh) man it's for the ghetto (yeah)

 Leanin dipped in rocks, pump the joint on the block
 Behind the Dolce Gabbana shades, peepin the spots
 Frostbit and I'm turnin blue, that's why I'm so hot
 Put the hustle down majorly and never get knocked
 Who can grind for this? Momma taught me to swerve
 Rent the presidential suite out, snatch ya bird
 My motto is dough or die, peace sign in the sky
 In the brand new 'lectric blue Bentley ridin by
 Hurt these clowns, anybody that want it
 Let you borrow my crown, tell me why would you flaunt it?
 Don't you know you can get it, have your wig-piece splitted
 Meth asked me to spit it, see my coupes is kitted
 And my minks is fitted, lyrically I'm sid-dick
 Honey frontin when you around, I always hit it
 The boss is home, regulatin on chrome
 Tell Russell it's line one, LL's on the phone

    Get off my niggy niggy nuts! (ha ha, ha ha-hah ha)
    (ha-hah, ha-hah-ha, ha ha-hah) Get off my niggy niggy nuts!
    (ha ha, ha ha-hah ha)
    (ha-hah, ha-hah-ha, ha ha-hah) Get off my niggy niggy nuts!

 Get them niggy nuts, now here's wiggy what
 Y'all need to do, when I come through, give it up
 Paper stackin, daddy get it crackin
 Chains might be gold, the joints always platinum
 (And rims) always chrome (jeans) always pressed
 (Loot) always right (cut) always fresh
 (Gear) always dipped (honey) always bangin
 (You hot?) Always, my niggy nuts always hangin
 Hold it down, rocks by the pound
 The new 2002 b-boy sound
 Hoes stand back, I'm shakin up the game
 You shoulda never tried, to SLIDE in my lane
 Guaranteed-to-blow-the-block-up
 When-I-ease-this milky white drop up
 Wanna bang ya, that's all you need to know
 50 deep in Summer Jam, I closed the show

 Nuts, y'all, baby - stay flowin!
 Hit Big B, tell him bring the Mo' in (bring it in)
 Uhh - we rockin to the rhythm (all night baby)
 Uncut raw, what we give 'em
 Hell yes - bounce to the music! (bounce)
 When the joint come on, everybody lose it
 (This year) leave the bar, hit the floor
 Represent, let these clowns know who you are
 When it's bangin like this, why stop? (Why stop?)
 Ask me why I pop Cris', why not? (Why not?)
 The flow of the century
 Got your Belve splashin to the melody, what you tellin me?
 This is fresh - 'til the day I die
 Leavin momma with a tear in her eye
 You was frontin for a minute, now what?
 You snapped when the joint dropped
