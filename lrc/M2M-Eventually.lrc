 
 
 

 
Eventually

 Open your eyes
 Undo the seem
 It's not like before
 It's not just a dream

 A hint of a smile
 As your hand touches mine
 No longer alone
 I feel them entwine

 Ah ah ah...Eventually
 

 I'm holding your hand
 You say quietly
 Baby don't go
 Stay here with me

 So this is it
 To you I belong
 No more goodbyes
 We knew all along

  Ah ah ah...Eventually
 

 Open you eyes shhh...
 It's not just a dream
