 Lying like needles
 On forest earth
 Euphoric rush
 Trees bend to pray for us
 I'm sputtering
 Like cold machines
 Late for the birth ritual, ritual, ritual, ritual
 You can drive my tail
 To watch the circus
 A birth ritual
 A birth of idiots
 Now I woke up blessed
 And good strives for heart ache
 Marked for the death ritual, ritual, ritual
   As you start the song
   And face this garden
   I light a cigarette before the execution
   Now you see your crime
   For every miracle
  Add another drug at every birth ritual
 I took the drug
 To make me stay
 And now everything
 Dies in shyness
 The snake retreats
 Admits defeat
 And waits for the birth ritual, ritual, ritual
 Shining light
 Child's highs
 Mark his sides
 Bright until the newness wears off
 Add another drug at every birth ritual
