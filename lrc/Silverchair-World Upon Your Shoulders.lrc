All the bridges in the world
Won't save you
If there is no other side
To cross to

When your world's not feeling ugly
And the world's not too much
Take the world upon your shoulders
And burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

Half full glasses
Lost in empty houses

Violent, big and violent
Like a thing that's big, big
And violent
