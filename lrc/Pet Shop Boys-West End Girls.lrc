 Sometimes you're better off dead
 There's gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head
 You think you're mad, too unstable
 Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
 In a restaurant in a West End town
 Call the police, there's a madman around
 Running down underground to a dive bar
 In a West End town
 In a West End town, a dead end world
 The East End boys and West End girls
 In a West End town, a dead end world
 The East End boys and West End girls
 West End girls
 
 Too many shadows, whispering voices
 Faces on posters, too many choices
 If, when, why, what
 How much have you got?
 Have you got it, do you get it?
 If so, how often?
 And which do you choose:
 A hard or soft option?
 (How much do you need?)
 In a West End town, a dead end world
 The East End boys and West End girls
 In a West End town, a dead end world
 The East End boys and West End girls
 West End girls
 West End girls
 
 You've got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
 Just you wait 'till I get you home
 We've got no future, we've got no past
 Here today, built to last
 In every city, in every nation
 From Lake Geneva to the Finland station
 (How far have you been?)
 In a West End town, a dead end world
 The East End boys and West End girls
 A West End town, a dead end world
 East End Boys, West End girls
 West End girls
