 Wrong
 Wrong
 Wrong
 Wrong
 
 I was born with the wrong sign
 In the wrong house
 With the wrong ascendancy
 I took the wrong road
 That led to the wrong tendencies
 I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
 For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme
 On the wrong day of the wrong week
 I used the wrong method with the wrong technique
 
 Wrong
 
 Wrong
 
 There's something wrong with me chemically
 Something wrong with me inherently
 The wrong mix in the wrong genes
 I reached the wrong ends by the wrong means
 It was the wrong plan
 In the wrong hands
 With the wrong theory for the wrong man
 The wrong lies, on the wrong vibes
 The wrong questions with the wrong replies
 
 Wrong
 
 Wrong
 
 I was marching to the wrong drum
 With the wrong scum
 Pissing out the wrong energy
 Using all the wrong lines
 And the wrong signs
 With the wrong intensity
 I was on the wrong page of the wrong book
 With the wrong rendition of the wrong hook
 Made the wrong move, every wrong night
 With the wrong tune played till it sounded right yeah
 
 Wrong
 
 Wrong
 
 Too long (Wrong)
 Too long (Wrong)
 Too long (Wrong)
 Too long (Wrong)
 Too long
 I was born with the wrong sign
 In the wrong house
 With the wrong ascendancy
 I took the wrong road
 That led to the wrong tendencies
 I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
 For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme
 On the wrong day of the wrong week
 I used the wrong method with the wrong technique
 
 Wrong
