 Something that I felt today, something that I had
 Swingin' from the chandoleres, hanging on your word
 I remember watchin' you once upon a time
 Dancing from across the room in another life
 A little bit of resolve is what I need now
 Pin me down, show me how
 A little bit of resolve is what I need now
 Pin me down, show me how
 
 Lookin' back to find my way, never sing so hard
 Yesterday's belated rest, changing of the gods
 I would never change a thing even if I could
 All the songs we used to sing, everything was gone
 A little bit of resolve is what I need now
 Pin me down, show me how
 A little bit of resolve is what I need now
 Pin me down, show me how
 
 One more louvre that you're not here
 It's gone and passed you by
 Happened to you, happened to you
 One more tear that you won't hear
 That's gone and passed you by
 Happened to you, happened to you
 A little bit of resolve is what I need now
 Pin me down, show me how
 A little bit of resolve is what I need now
 Pin me down, show me how
 A little bit of resolve
 One more louvre that you're not here
 It's gone and passed you by (A little bit of resolve)
 
 A little bit of resolve
 One more louvre that you're not here
 It's gone and passed you by (A little bit of resolve)
