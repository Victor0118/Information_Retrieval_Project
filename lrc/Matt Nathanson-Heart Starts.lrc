      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Heart Starts - Matt Nathanson . Don't go, don't go Don't go, don't go . Maybe this heart of mine is paralyzed, 'Cause b's out building rocket ships And shooting for the skies. I had a f*cked up week that lasted years. I landed like a cannonball, Waiting for the crowd to cheer. . All I know is the world is filled With broken things. All I know, with these walls I built, I can't get to what you need. . Don't go, don't go Love me 'til my heart starts. Love me 'til my heart starts. Don't go, don't go Love me 'til my heart starts. Love me 'til my heart starts. . Found a dead end girl to read my palm. Yeah, she was into losing streaks, So I let her take me on. A million miles away, lost at sea, She burned like a fire Only drowning men could see. . All I know is the world is filled With broken things. All I know, with these walls I built, I can't get to what you need. . Don't go, don't go Love me 'til my heart starts. Love me 'til my heart starts. Don't go, don't go Love me 'til my heart starts. Love me 'til my heart starts . I wanna feel it kick in. I wanna feel it kick in. I wanna feel it kick in this time. I wanna feel it kick in. I wanna feel it kick in. I wanna feel it kick in this time. . All I know is the world is filled With broken things. All I know, with these walls I built, I can't get to what you need. . Don't go, don't go Love me 'til my heart starts. Love me 'til my heart starts. Don't go, don't go Love me 'til my heart starts. Love me 'til my heart starts. . I wanna feel it kick in. I wanna feel it kick in. I wanna feel it kick in this time. I wanna feel it kick in. I wanna feel it kick in. I wanna feel it kick in this time. . Don't go, don't go Love me 'til my heart starts. Love me 'til my heart starts. . 歌词编辑：活在當下     QQ：6313827
