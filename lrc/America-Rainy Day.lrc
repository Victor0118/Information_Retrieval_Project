Whenever it's a rainy day
I pack my troubles up in my room
I chase all the clouds away
I get myself back to the womb

But I know that you're gonna cry
Tears are runnin' from your eyes
The piece of my life you take
Is one that so often breaks

Whenever you are miles away
I think of you the way you are
Your shining lips, your auburn hair
And then it don't seem quite so far

Well I know that you're gonna cry
Tears are runnin' from your eyes
The piece of my life you take
Is one that so often breaks

Well I know that you're gonna cry
Tears are runnin' from your eyes
The piece of my life you take
Is one that so often breaks
