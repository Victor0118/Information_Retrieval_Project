In ages past when spells were cast
In a time of men in steel
When a man was taught no special thing
It was all done by feel

So listen, so learn, so read on
You gotta turn the page, read the Book of Taliesyn

Hear the song of lovely Joan
Her sound so sweet and clear
In the courtroom of the King
Among children and the peers

So listen, so learn, so read on
You gotta turn the page, read the Book of Taliesyn

     "Now hear ye the words of Taliesyn, 
      on the foaming beach of the ocean,
      in the day of trouble, 
      I shall be of more service to thee
      than three hundred salmon..."

The hare he bounds across the page
Past castles white and fair
Past dreaming chessmen on their boards
With a fool's mate as a snare

So listen, so learn, so read on
You gotta turn the page, read the Book of Taliesyn

     "Three times I have been born
      I know this from meditation..."

The bird he flies the distance
From pages two to six
Past minstrels in their boxes
To the waters of the Styx

So listen, so learn, so read on
You gotta turn the page, read the Book of Taliesyn

Don't take the pictures lightly
Listen to their sound
For from their coloured feeling
Experience is found

So listen, so learn, so read on
You gotta turn the page, read the Book of Taliesyn

     "All the sciences of the world are collected in my breast, 
      for I  know  what  has  been,  what is  now,  
      and  what  hereafter  will occur..."
