     歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Byblos(LP Version) - Chicago I saw her once before; she didn't turn me on.  One night she stopped to talk to pass the time.  And then I saw her eyes; her softly smiling glow,  We sat and talked all night at Byblos.  She talked of feelings that I knew were true.  She painted me a picture using ev'ry shade of blue  It was light with laughter,  At times it made me cry,  And now I'll never know just  why I didn't ever try to hold her;  to squeeze her; to kiss her all night long, I never tried to please her.  Then, soon she had to go;  I sat there all alone  And thought of things she said The whole day through.  And then I realized, I never took the time  To find out where she lived Or where to call.  I thought that I would see Her the next night,  Anticipating how I'd set myself right.  Then, I went back to Byblos;  I sat there and waited,  Feeling just a little nervous And a little frustrated.  Then, soon, in she came,  looking just the same  Oo, I could hardly wait to take her far from the game.  Then a person came in to the club  that I had to speak to I explained the situation to her  And i thought she understood  But I guess she thought I was jiving her around  Cause when I looked for her, this is what I found  She was rapping with a real good friend of mine,  He was happening, I guess it was his time.  I really couldn't blame him, cause he was sad and lonely too.  But just talking to her did me so much good, I knew she'd do him good too.  Then I went home and I got it on,  Sat down to write these words when I was finally alone.  And then, about halfway through  I wondered if someone knew  where she was, so I could give her a call, And I found out that she was right down the hall,  Not too far away,  but that's ok, I'll just wait for the day when I can see her again and spend some time.  陈先生  QQ：1552195557
