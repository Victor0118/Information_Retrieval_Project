      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Martina McBride – Cry on the Shoulder of the Road . I'm rolling out of Bakersfield My own private hell on wheels But this time I'm gone for good And I've never gone this far before Beyond the slamming of the back screen door But you never loved me like you should . And there ain't no telling what I'll find But I might as well move down the line There's no comfort here in your zip code I'd rather break down on the highway With no one to share my load And cry on the shoulder of the road . It makes me feel a little low Steel guitar on the radio And it's kinda scary the way these truckers fly So this how leaving feels Drinking coffee and making deals with the One above To get me though the night . And there ain't no telling what I'll find But I might as well move down the line There's no comfort here in your zip code I'd rather break down on the highway With no one to share my load And cry on the shoulder of the road . And there ain't no telling what I'll find But I might as well move down the line There's no comfort here in your zip code I'd rather break down on the highway With no one to share my load And cry on the shoulder of the road . And cry on the shoulder of the road . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
