 Moby
 
 You would never make it
 Inside , oh inside
 Love you won't be alone
 Inside, oh inside

     Pain
     It's cold out there
     So come inside
     So come inside

  Pain
  It's warm in here
  So come inside
  So come inside

 How we will make it
 Just you, you and me
 Soon we'll take it
 Just you, you and me

 Pain
 Yeahhh
 Pain
 Yeahhh
