 I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
 Whatever happened to our love?
 I wish I understood
 It used to be so nice, it used to be so good
 So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
 S. O. S.
 The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
 S. O. S.
 When you're gone
 How can I even try to go on?
 When you're gone
 Though I try how can I carry on?
 You seem so far away though you are standing near
 You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
 I really tried to make it out
 I wish I understood
 What happened to our love, it used to be so good
 So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
 S. O. S.
 The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
 S. O. S.
 When you're gone
 How can I even try to go on?
 When you're gone
 Though I try how can I carry on?
 So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
 S. O. S.
 And the love you gave me, nothing else can save me
 S. O. S.
 When you're gone
 How can I even try to go on?
 When you're gone
 Though I try how can I carry on?
 When you're gone
 How can I even try to go on?
 When you're gone
 Though I try how can I carry on?
