 You are my life
 My happiest moments wouldn't be complete if you weren't by my side
 You're my relation
 In connection to the sun
 With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't over come
 You are my raindrops
 I am the seed
 With you and God, who's my sunlight I'll bloom and grow so beautifly
 Baby I'm so proud, so proud to be your girl
 You make this confusion go on away from this cold and mixed-up world

      (I'm) I'm in love with you
      You set me free
      I can't do this thing called life without you here with me cause I'm
      Dangerously in love with you
      I'll never leave
      Just keep lovin' me the way I love you lovin me

 And I know you love me
 Love me for who I am
 Cause years before I became who I am, baby you were my man
 I know it ain't easy, easy lovin me
 But I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
 Later on in my destiny
 I see myself having your child
 I see myself being your wife, and I see my whole future in your eyes
 The thought of all my love for you
 Sometimes makes me wanna cry
 Cause I realize all my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side

Bridge
 Everytime I see your face
 My heart smiles
 Everytime it feels so good, and it hurts sometimes
 Created in this world to love, to hold, to feel, to breathe, to live you
 Dangerously in love...
 Dangerously................love......
