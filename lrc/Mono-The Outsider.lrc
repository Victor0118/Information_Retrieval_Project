 I will never witness your love again
 I will never witness your love again
 
 I will never knew the stranger in you
 I will never knew the stranger in you
 
 The stranger the stranger the stranger ....
 
 I will not surrender my life for you
 I will not surrender my life for you
 
 You only see the sadness in me
 I never knew the stranger in you
 
 The stranger the stranger the stranger ....
