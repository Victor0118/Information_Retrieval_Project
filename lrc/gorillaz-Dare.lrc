      It's coming up
     It's coming up
     It's coming up
     It's coming up
         It's DARE
    
    You got to press it on you
    You just protect it
    That′s what you do, baby
    Hold it down, DARE
    
    Jump with the moon and move it
    Jump back and forth
    It feels like you 
    would let yourself work it out
      Never did no harm
