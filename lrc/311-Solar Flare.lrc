 Not the back of a gentle mother
 I do like a manhole cover
 It keeps on pounding my head
 We'll order water
 Torture sauce and economics
 Every day just more comics
 In a pissing contest
 That started out with atomic bombs
 Mom will they drop the bomb
 Will they think about their children's children
 Be a forwardless mess and this
 No one to call
 You can't make them stall
 I want to feed them to each other
 Cause I'm sick of them all
 
 How can't you see something's missing
 Is anyone listening
 We're shooting up flares
 Does anyone care
 They got this world locked down bound and gagged
 From the reds in Pine Ridge to that land in Bagdad
 
 When did our leaders
 Become bottom feeders
 We're shooting up flares
 Does anyone care
 They got this world locked down bound and gagged
 With constant fear and paranoia toxins in our head
 
 It's just something they know how to do
 How to make everyone feel uncalm
 The masses just take it while they turn the screws
 Bring to a boil, add oil, then bomb
 It's just something that we got to fight
 How to make everyone feel uncalm
 Keep us distracted with ???
 
 Porno shows, MTV hoes, and all the radio
 It's the same fucking song
 That's just the way it goes
 Cold turkey world to democracy's girls
 From the rules of engagements sweet heart
 This is the world
 
 How can so many sit silent
 Enough to the violence
 We're shooting up flares
 Does anyone care
 They got this world locked down bound and gagged
 The Botox, Barbie dolls, and magazine ads
 
 It's just something they know how to do
 How to make everyone feel uncalm
 The masses just take it while they turn the screws
 Bring to a boil, add oil, then bomb
 Embodying all that we know to be wrong
 How to make everyone feel uncalm
 When a war chant becomes a popular song
