   Along her vain parade
  Along her veins
 All of seventeen
 Eyes a purple green
 Treated like a queen
 She was on borrowed self-esteem
 She would do her dance
 A painful masquerade
 Spinning you into her web
 In her uniform
 Studded brass and steel
 Kissing napkin lipstick stains
 And smearing sincerity
 Time crept up on her
 She's early gray
 Her reflection looks concerned
 And flowers hit her grave
