Verse
She was my best friend.
She was my best friend.
We won't reach up again.
We broke all our plans.

Refrain
You've got a face, a soul, a name
but if you stay we both will go insane.
Nostalgia.

We can't talk about old days everytime our children'll play.
What kind of memories becomes of such a melancholy day.

Refrain
You've got a face, a soul, a name
but if you stay we both will go insane.
Nostalgia, you're just good for one day.

I tried to leave you many times I almost succeeded once.
Dreams are coming one by one to ask me what I've done.
Now I hear it in the wind when old news are coming in.
She did so well without me but I wonder if she's free.

You've got a face, a soul, a name
but if you stay we both will go insane.
You've got a face, a soul, a name
but if you stay we both will go insane.
Nostalgia, you're just good for one day.
Nostalgia, you're just good for one day
