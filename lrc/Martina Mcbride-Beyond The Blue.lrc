      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Martina McBride – Beyond the Blue . The sky's been grey every day since I lost you But I know the sun is shinin' somewhere, beyond the blue My eyes were red when you said that we were through But now I can see better days for me, just beyond the blue . Beyond the blue, on the other side of lonely And it's only a matter of time, until I'm Lookin' back and feelin' like I'm over you When these tears are gone and I'm beyond the blue . Beyond the blue, on the other side of lonely And it's only a matter of time, until I'm On my feet and I meet somebody new And I fall in love again beyond the blue When these tears are gone and I'm beyond the blue . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
