 
 
 
 
 Are you back in my life to stay
 Or is it just for today
 Oh that you're gonna need me?
 If it's a thrill you're looking for
 Honey, I'm flexible. Oh, yeah.
 
 Just be for real won't you, Baby
 Be for real oh, Baby
 You see I, I don't want to be hurt by love again
 
 So you see I'm not naive.
 I just would like to believe
 Ah what you tell me.
 So don't give me the world today
 And tomorrow take it away.
 Don't do that to me, darling.
 
 Just be for real won't you, Baby
 Be for real won't you, Baby
 
 You see I, I don't want to be hurt by love again.
 Been hurt so many times
 You see I, I don't want to be hurt by love again.
 
 (I don't give a damn about the truth, Baby
 Except for the naked truth. Oh yeah)
 
 Just be for real won't you, Baby
 Be for real won't you, Baby
 
 You see I, I don't want to be hurt by love again.
 No, no, no, no
 It's just that I, I don't want to be hurt by love again.
 Thanks for the song Mr. Knight.
