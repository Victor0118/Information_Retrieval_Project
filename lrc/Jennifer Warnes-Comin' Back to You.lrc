Maybe I'm still hurting
I can't turn the other cheek
But you know that I still love you
It's just that I can't speak
I looked for you in everyone
And they called me on that too
I lived alone but I was only
Coming back to you

They're shutting down the factory now
Just when all the bills are due
And the fields are under lock and key
Tho' the rain and the sun come through
And springtime starts but then it stops
In the name of something new
And all the senses rise against this
Coming back to you

And they're handing down my sentence now
I know what I must do
Another mile of silence while I'm
Coming back to you

There are many in your life
Many still to be
Since you are a shining light
There's many that you'll see
So I got a deal with envy
When you choose the precious few
Who've left their pride on the other side of
Coming back to you

Even in your arms I know
I'll never get it right
Even when you bend to give me
Comfort in the night
So I've got to have your word on this
Or none of it is true
And all I've said was just instead of
Coming back to you
