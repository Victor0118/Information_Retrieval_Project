 Hold up?
 hold on?
 don't be scared 
 Youl never change what been and gone 
 May your smile
 Shine on?
  Don't be scared 
 Your destiny may keep you warm.
    Cos all of the stars are fading away 
    Just try not to worry youl see them some day 
    Take what you need and be on your way 
    And stop crying your heart out 
 Get up? 
 Come on?
 why you scared 
 Youl never change what been and gone
