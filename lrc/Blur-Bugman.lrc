 I am an ex offender
 They let me out in the summer
 I think I was in a coma
 I didn't know what to do
 Oh no
 You go hang around go round
  I'll watch myself hang on
    Look out for the Bugman
   You go hang around around
 I got no sent of existence
 I know the nodding dogs
 I go out in the city
 I stay away from the bugs
 Oh yeah
  I watch myself hang on
 The bu uh uh ug man
