 (Don't forget about us)
 Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
 No baby, no baby, no baby no
 Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
 My baby boy...
 Just let it die
 With no goodbyes
 Details don't matter
 We both paid the price
 Tears in my eyes
 You know sometimes
 It'd be like that baby
 
 Now everytime I see you
 I pretend I'm fine
 When I wanna reach out to you
 But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
 Baby I must confess
 We were bigger than anything
 Remember us at our best
 And don't forget about
 
 Late nights, playin' in the dark
 And wakin' up inside my arms
 Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
 I can see it in your eyes
 You still want it
 So don't forget about us
 I'm just speaking from experience
 Nothing can compare to your first true love
 So I hope this will remind you
 When it's for real, it's forever
 So don't forget about us
 Oh they say
 That you're in a new relationship
 But we both know
 Nothing comes close to
 What we had, it perseveres
 That we both can't forget it
 How good we used to get it
 
 There's only one me and you
 And how we used to shine
 No matter what you go through
 We are one, that's a fact
 That you can't deny
 So baby we just can't let
 The fire pass us by
 Forever we'd both regret
 So don't forget about
 Late nights, playin' in the dark
 And wakin' up inside my arms
 Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
 I can see it in your eyes
 You still want it
 So don't forget about us
 I'm just speaking from experience
 Nothing can compare to your first true love
 So I hope this will remind you
 When it's for real, it's forever
 So don't forget about us
 And if she's got your head all messed up now
 That's the trickery
 She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be
 I bet she can't do like me
 She'll never be MC
 Baby don't you, don't you forget about us
  Late nights, playin' in the dark
  And wakin' up inside my arms
  Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
  I can see it in your eyes
  You still want it
  So don't forget about us
  I'm just speaking from experience
  Nothing can compare to your first true love
  So I hope this will remind you
  When it's for real, it's forever
  So don't forget about us
 Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
 No baby, no baby, no baby no
 Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
 When it's for real, it's forever
 So don't forget about us.
