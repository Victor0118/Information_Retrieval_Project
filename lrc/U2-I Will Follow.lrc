 I will Follow...
 
 I was on the outside when you said
 You said you needed me 
 I was looking at myself
 I was blind, I could not see
 
 A boy tries hard to be a man
 His mother takes him by his hand
 If he stops to think he starts to cry
 Oh why
 
 If you walkaway, walkaway
 I walkaway, walkaway...I will follow
 If you walkaway, walkaway
 I walkaway, walkaway...I will follow
 
 I was on the inside
 When they pulled the four walls down
 I was looking through the window
 I was lost, I am found
 Walkaway, walkaway
 I walkaway, walkaway...I will follow
 If you walkaway, walkaway
 I walkaway, walkaway...I will follow
 
 Your eyes make a circle
 I see you when I go in there
 Your eyes, your eyes...
 
 If you walkaway, walkaway
 I walkaway, walkaway...I will follow
 If you walkaway, walkaway
 I walkaway, walkaway...I will follow
 I will follow
 I will follow...
