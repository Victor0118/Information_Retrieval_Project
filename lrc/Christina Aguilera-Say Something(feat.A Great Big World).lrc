     Say Something(feat.Christina Aguilera) - A Great Big World  Lrc制作:潇风寒月 QQ:395254794  Say something, I'm giving up on you.  I'll be the one, if you want me to.  Anywhere, I would've followed you.  Say something, I'm giving up on you.  And I am feeling so small.  It was over my head  I know nothing at all.  And I will stumble and fall.  I'm still learning to love  Just starting to crawl.  Say something, I'm giving up on you.  I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you.  Anywhere, I would've followed you.  Say something, I'm giving up on you.  And I will swallow my pride.  You're the one that I love  And I'm saying goodbye.  Say something, I'm giving up on you.  And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you.  And anywhere, I would have followed you.  Oh-oh-oh-oh  say something, I'm giving up on you.  Say something, I'm giving up on you.  Say something.  歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com
