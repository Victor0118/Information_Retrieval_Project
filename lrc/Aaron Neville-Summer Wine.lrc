 Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
 My summer wine is really made from all these things

(LEE):
 I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
 A song that I had only sang to just a few
 She saw my silver spurs and said lets pass some time
 And I will give to you summer wine
 Ohh-oh-oh summer wine

(NANCY):
 Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
 My summer wine is really made from all these things
 Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
 And I will give to you summer wine
 Ohhh-oh summer wine

(LEE):
 My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak
 I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
 She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
 And then she gave to me more summer wine
 Ohh-oh-oh summer wine

(NANCY):
 Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
 My summer wine is really made from all these things
 Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
 And I will give to you summer wine
 Mmm-mm summer wine

(LEE):
 When I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes
 My silver spurs were gone my head felt twice its size
 She took my silver spurs a dollar and a dime
 And left me cravin' for more summer wine
 Ohh-oh-oh summer wine

(NANCY):
 Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
 My summer wine is really made from all these things
 Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
 And I will give to you summer wine
 Mmm-mm summer wine 
 Ohh-oh-oh summer wine
