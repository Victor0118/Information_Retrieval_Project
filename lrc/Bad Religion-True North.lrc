      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com Bad Religion - True North . Unrepentant vagabond Plot the new coordinates and cast the map aside Now I gotta ramble on Navigate the pitfalls and cross the great divide . The mapmaker's legend gave direction and a key He set the declination but what good is it to me? . I can't see the rationality The world's not my responsibility And happiness isn't there for me But maybe I'll inch closer to the source When I find true north (With or without a friend, Keep searching 'til the end) . Tempting fate and cheating death No one ever told me it was gonna be like this Contemplate the randomness When the mind is willing it gets downright perilous . Overburdened, underwhelmed, their ethical decrees That's your moral compass but what good is it to me? . I can't see the rationality The world's not my responsibility And happiness isn't there for me But maybe I'll inch closer to the source When I find true north (With or without a friend, Keep searching 'til the end) When I find true north. . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
