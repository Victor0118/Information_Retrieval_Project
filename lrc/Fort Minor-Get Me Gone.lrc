 The dude, he said that, like,
 when we were making the first Linkin Park record
 He was like,
 "Yeah you know, I don't know about the rapping like,
 I don't know... maybe you should just be a rock band."
 You know what I mean, like, trying to change us
 like they signed us as an act like what we sound like and then he's like
 "Oh I don't know maybe you should just play keyboard"
 
 Before the first song that you heard me on
 There were people already tryin' to get me gone
 Tellin' me to quit rapping
 "Just play the keys"
 That my band had a singer
 They didn't need me
 But my band had my back
 So we did the tracks
 Put out the album and the talk went flat
 It was funny at first but then the humour faded
 When some magazines printed that our label made us
 We were to be good to be true
 Some were saying ghost writers were writin' all that we do
 So we had to disprove it
 We spelled it out to the detail how we do it when we're making this music
 After that I made it a rule
 I only do e-mail responses to print interviews
 Because these people love to put a twist to your words
 To infer that you said something fucking absurd
 
 Oh, did I lose you at infer?
 Not used to hearing a verse that uses over first grade vocabulary words?
 People used to infer that we were manufactured
 Now I've got the interviews on file
 Which people said what
 Which number to dial
 So now every enemy screaming insanity
 All they're ever gonna be's another big fan of me
 Bitch
