 The currents will shift
 Glide me towards...
 You know something's left
 And we're all allowed
 To dream of the next
 Oh, ohh the next, time we touch...
 Oooh...
 You don't have to stray
 Tho oceans away
 Waves roll in my thoughts
 Hold tight the ring...
 The sea will rise...
 Please stand by the shore...
 Oh, oh, oh, I will be...
 I will be there once more...
 Oooh...
 Uh huh, oh yeah...
