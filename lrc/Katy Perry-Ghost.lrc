     Ghost 演唱：Katy Perry Lrc By 潇风寒月 QQ:395254794 You said I text It's like the wind changed your mind We were best friends Yeah, we were burning our lives With every kiss, and every letter Every promise of forever, oh But you hit send And disappeared in front of my eyes 歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com And now you’re just a ghost When I look back never would have known that You could be so cold Like a stranger vanish like a vapor There's just an echo where your heart used to be Now I see it clearly And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep My vision's 20/20 I see through you now  Something is tight Now that I have made up my mind I'll be alright It doesn't harm me at night  'Cause every gift, every letter, every promise of forever Now, it's out of sight Like you were never alive  And now you’re just a ghost When I look back never would have known that You could be so cold Like a stranger vanish like a vapor There's just an echo where your heart used to be Now I see it clearly And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep My vision's 20/20 I see through you now  Now, now, now, now  So rest in piece I see you on the other side  And now you’re just a ghost When I look back never would have known that You could be so cold Like a stranger vanish like a vapor There's just an echo where your heart used to be Now I see it clearly And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep My vision's 20/20 I see through you now  Now, now, now, now I see through you now Now, now, now, now I see through you now
