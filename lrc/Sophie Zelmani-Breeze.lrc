My heart is leaving you
it says goodbye
Disappearing from you tonight
Not a breeze is gonna
pass you by

There are sailing boats
There are ships
broken rafts adrift
I'm jumping on whatever's passing by

I've blown the candle out
that you forgot
I've made sure that
the door is shut
I don't think you're ever
coming back

My heart is leaving you
it says goodbye
Disappearing from you tonight
Not a breeze is gonna
pass you by
