 You used to get it in your fishnets
 Now you only get it in your night dress
 Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
 Landed in a very common crisis
 Everything's in order in a black hole
 Nothing seems as pretty as the past, though
 That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
 Remember when he used to be a rascal?
 Oh, the boy's a slag
 The best you ever had
 The best you ever had
 Is just a memory and those dreams
 Weren't as daft as they seem
 Not as daft as they seem, my love
 When you dream them up
 
 Flicking through a little book of sex tips
 Remember when the boys were all electric?
 Now when she tells she's gonna get it
 I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
 Clinging to not getting sentimental
 Said she wasn't going, but she went still
 Likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
 Was it a megadobber or a betting pencil?
 Oh, the boy's a slag
 The best you ever had
 The best you ever had
 Is just a memory and those dreams
 Weren't as daft as they seem
 Not as daft as they seem, my love
 When you dream them up, oh...
 
 Where did you go?
 Where did you go?
 Where did you go?
 Ohh oh...
 
 Falling about
 You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
 You just sounded it out
 You're not coming back again
