If only fame had an IV baby could I bare, being away from you I found the vein put it here. I live for the applause, applause, applause. I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause. Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me. The applause, applause, applause. Give me that thing that I love turn turn the lights  Put your hands up make'em touch it real  Give me that thing that I love turn turn the lights  Put your hands up make'em touch it real  A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E Make it real loud your hands up make'em  A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E Make it real loud your hands up make'em  I've overheard your theory, nostalgia's for geeks. I guess sir, if you say so, some of us just like to read. One second I'm a Koons fan, suddenly the Kunst is me. Pop culture was in art now, Art in Pop culture in me. I live for the applause, applause, applause. I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause. Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me. The applause, applause, applause. Give me that thing that I love turn turn the lights  put your hands up make'em touch it real  Give me that thing that I love turn turn the lights  Put your hands up make'em touch it real  A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E Make it real loud your hands up make'em  A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E Make it real loud your hands up make'em  Wooh! Touch-touch! Wooh! Touch-touch now! Wooh! I live for the applause, applause, applause. I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause. Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me. The applause, applause, applause. Give me that thing that I love turn turn the lights  put your hands up make'em touch it real  Give me that thing that I love turn turn the lights  Put your hands up make'em touch it real  A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E Make it real loud your hands up make'em  A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E Make it real loud! your hands up make'em  A-R-T-P-O-P
