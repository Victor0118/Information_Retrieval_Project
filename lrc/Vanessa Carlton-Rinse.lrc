 She'd do anything to sparkle in his eye
 She would suffer, she would fight, and compromise
 She's been wishin' on the stars that shine so bright
 For answers to the questions
 that will haunt her tonight
 
 She must rinse this all away
 She can't hold him this way
 She must rinse this all away
 She can't love him this way
 
 How she'd be soothed
 How she'd be saved if he could see
 She needs to be held in his arms to be free
 But everything happens for reasons
 that she will never understand
 'Til she knows the heart of a woman
 will never be found in the arms of a man
 
 She must rinse this all away
 She can't hold anybody this way
 She must rinse this all away
 She can't love him
 
 And if she runs away
 She fears she won't be followed
 What could be the worse than leaving something behind
 And as the depth of oceans slowly become shallow
 It's loneliness she finds...
 If only he was mine
 
 She'd do anything to spakle in his eye
 She would suffer, she would fight, and compromise
 She's been wishin' on the stars that shine so bright
 For answers to the questions
 that will haunt her tonight
 
 She must rinse him
 She must rinse him
 She can't rinse him
 She can't rinse him
 She can't, she won't, she must rinse him
 She can't, she won't, she must rinse him
 She must rinse this all away
 She can't hold him this way
 She must rinse this all away
 She can't love him this way
