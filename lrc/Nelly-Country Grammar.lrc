 (HOT SHIT!)
 I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover (c'mon)
 Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go (HOT SHIT!)
 Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
 Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

 Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound

 Mmmmm, you can find me, in St. Louis rollin on dubs
 Smokin on dubs in clubs, blowin up like cocoa puffs
 Sippin Bud, gettin perved and getting dubbed
 Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
 And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough stretch
 just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
 and it's candy painted, fans fainted - while I'm entertainin
 Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin
 I hang with Hannibal Lector (HOT SHIT!) so feel me when I bring it
 Sing it loud (what?) I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
 Run a mile - for the cause, I'm righteous above the law
 Playa my style's raw, I'm "Born to Mack" like Todd Shaw
 Forget the fame, and the glamour
 Give me D's wit a rubber hammer
 My grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
 Fuck bionic it's ironic, slammin niggaz like Onyx
 Lunatics til the day I die
 I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics
 I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover (c'mon)
 Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go (HOT SHIT!)
 Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound

 Frown niggaz, talkin shit when I leave the town nigga
 Say now, can you hoes come out to play now
 Hey I'm, ready to cut you up any day now
 Play by, my rules Boo and you gon' stay high
 May I, answer yo' +Third Question+ like A.I.
 Say hi, to my niggaz left in the slamma
 From St. Louis to Memphis
 From Texas back up to Indiana, Chi-Town
 K.C. Motown to Alabama
 L-A, New York Yankee niggaz to Hotlanta

 Smokin blunts in Sanah
 Blow thirty mill' like I'm Hammer
