      歌词千寻 www.lrcgc.com All Through The Night - Hayley Westenra . Sleep, my child And peace attend thee All through the night . Guardian angels God will send thee All through the night . Soft the drowsy hours Are creeping Hill and dale In slumber sleeping . I my loved one Vigil keeping All through the night .  ............ . While the moon Her watch is keeping All through the night . While the weary world Is sleeping All through the night . O'er thy spirit Gently stealing Visions of delight  Revealing . Breathes a pure And holy feeling All through the night . 歌词编辑：活在當下  QQ：6313827
