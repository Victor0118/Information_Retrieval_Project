 Frozen winds surround my face
 In the cover of darkness I can make believe
 It's you
 I feel you like the rain
 I feel you like a storm cloud building in my heart
 I wonder if you know the pain
 To want the one thing you haven't got
     Just a twist in time...and you could be mine
     Just a sip of wine...and you could be mine
  Just a kiss devine
 A hand brushes by my love
 A smile fuels a steel inferno
 You don't have to die to leave my world
 Stand still and you've departed
 It seems I'm not on your mind and I'm wasting my time
 I'm just a fool to believe
 In the death of the night can you feel me inside
 I wish that you could conceive
    Just a kiss devine...and you could be mine
      
 Won't you leave me in the darkness
 Take away the pride, all the dignity that's burning inside
 Can't you see I'm standing naked
 I'll bear all the crosses and the crucifixes you can provide
 If you could decide
 Just a twist in time
 Just a sip of wine
