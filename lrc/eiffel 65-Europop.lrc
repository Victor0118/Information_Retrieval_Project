 and we play it loud cause it's groovy with a style
     
 it's a cultural thing from all country wide
 it's a musical flag and we call it europop
   always europop : europop
 from the tv sets to the radio
 you can feel the force of the music in the night
   all through amsterdam straight to italy
   you can feel the beat of a european thing
 europop
