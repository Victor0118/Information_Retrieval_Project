Green Day - Holiday
专辑:American Idiot
Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon plague (Hey!)
The shame, the ones who die without a name
Hear the dogs howlin' out of key
To a hymn called Faith and Misery (Hey!)
A plead, the company lost the war today
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday
There's a drum pounding out of time
Another protestor has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen (Amen)
There's a flag wrapped around the score of men (HEY!)
A gag, A plastic bag on a monument
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday
"The representative from California has the floor"
Zieg heil to the president gasbag
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel tower
who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass man
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fires, setting fire
Thats not a way that's meant for me
Just cause,Just cause because were outlaws yeah!
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday
END
