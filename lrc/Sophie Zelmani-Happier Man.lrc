It has never been this quiet and we have never seen a storm.
Though you really made things quiet I think I will stay calm.
Cause' I can't move the slightest finger let alone raise my hand.
I'm sure we lived like lovers but you dreamt of becoming a happier man.
I can't tell what I had chosen.
If no choices of this kind can be made.
I was happy for a long time but that's not what I feel today.
It has never been this dreamlike and we have never seen a ghost.
Though you are bringing me a nightmare it's not what frightens me the most.
You make me go through my visions and what it was that we achieved.
You make me ransack love for it's goodness and if love ever leads to harmony if love ever leads to harmony
