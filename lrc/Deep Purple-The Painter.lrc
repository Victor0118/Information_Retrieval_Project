Painter
Come colour up my life
Oh painter
Come colour up my life
Take away the misery
Take away the strife

Writer
Make me up a play
Writer
Make the meaning gay
 
Just give me words to say

Singer
Let me sing a song
Singer
Let me sing a song
You don't have to worry
Cause singer you can sing along
