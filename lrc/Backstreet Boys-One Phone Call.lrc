  Splendidyang
  Hard to believe it
  Its almost a year since
  I got to hold you, head on my shoulder
  Dodging the daylight taking the blame I
  Its all I got left, so lately Ive spent
  Every single night like its 25 to life
  And this sentence Ive been living is alone and unforgiven
  And Im guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart
  But even Ive got rights, your always gonna be my
  Wooow
  Always be my one phone call
  All I want, all I need is one phone call
  Im gonna leave my message at the tone
  Begging pretty baby please come home
  Cause youre my one, always be my one phone call
  First time it rings I, cant help but think of the first time I saw you
  That moment I knew
  Holding the phone tight, I hear the tone twice
  If you just pick up, swear I can fix us
  Every single night feels like 25 to life
  And this sentence Ive been living is alone and unforgiven
  And Im guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart
  But even Ive got rights, your always gonna be my
  Wooow
  Always be my one phone call
  All I want, all I need is one phone call
  Im gonna leave my message at the tone
  Begging pretty baby please come home
  Cause youre my one, always be my one phone call
  So let me make my case
  That way you wont erase the message that Im leaving for you now
  But if you do at least you knew
  Cause youre my one
  Always be my one phone call
  All I want, all I need is one phone call
  Im gonna leave my message at the tone
  Begging pretty baby please come home（oh! baby come home）
  Cause youre my one, always be my one phone call
  Youll always be my one
  Wooo yeah
  Youll always be my one
  Cause youre my one（Cause youre my one）
  Always be my one phone call
  Youre always be my one phone call
  Backstreet back all right
