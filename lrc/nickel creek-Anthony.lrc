 Anthony, Anthony
 Oh, he said he can't love me
 But I think he can
 
 Yes, I think he can
 I told him that just before he ran
 Just before he ran
 Mmm, mmm
 Mmm, mmm
 And he's not lookin' back
 
 He's not lookin' back
 Cause he doesn't want anything I have
 Or anything I am
 Anthony, Anthony
 Oh, he said he can't love me
 Anthony
