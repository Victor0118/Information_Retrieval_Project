 Willing and able to run
 I am
 Willing and able I'm able to come
 I am willing and able to run
 I am
 Willing and able I'm able to come
  And if I wait for you now
  Would you come
  Would you run
  Would you bring it back around
  Oh, baby how
 Willing and able to run
 I am
 Willing and able I'm able to come
 
 If it all went away 
 Nothin' left to say
 oh Would you fight it or would you lay down
 At the hand of your God
 oh could you see the light
 Oh my prince can't you see what's been found
 Willing and able to run
 Willing and able to come 
 willing and able to run, 
 I am willing, I am willing,
 willing,willing.
 
 Willing and able to run
 I am
 Willing and able I'm able to come
 I am willing and able to run
 I am
 Willing and able I'm able to come
  And if I wait for you now
  Would you come
  Would you run
  Would you bring it back around
  Oh, baby how
 
 Willing and able to run
 I am
 Willing and able I'm able to come
 I am willing and able to run
 I am
 Willing and able I'm able to come
