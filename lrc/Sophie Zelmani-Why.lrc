I don't think about it anymore so why do you?
I don't remember much but I'm sure that we were through.
I'm looking for your eyes to search for what they might disguise so why do you?
I've got no problem so why do you?
You're blowing on the ashes that's what I think you do.
It's been a secret that never got that deep inside so it hurt the spot at any time.
That deep inside, to hurt the spot, at any time.
After all this time why would I turn around for you?
The truth has faded into a lie.
Among all things that I could do I obviously still bother you why do I?
I'm just wishing you could forgive.
It is what we do, to make life easier to live.
