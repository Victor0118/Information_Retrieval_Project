 Take a message to your head
 Just stay beside her in the bed
 You were so stupid
 To believe in things you couldn't see
 Then make them all you want

 If you haven't got the reasons
 Just make up any reasons
 Then pick them ‘til they're torn

 Take it all away
 You took your coat today
 But they all go back in the morning
 
 Make a time to find your way
 I got a little further today
 Wash your eyes clear of anything
 Make them empty circles

 Dress yourself in black or grey
 I’m hungry like a wild waif or only child
 This lithium is heroin to me
 
 It makes it all withdraw
 All the anger and loss
 But it all keeps coming back in the morning

 You keep yourself too clean
 You dig yourself a dream
 That we won’t be coming home alone

 Not this time
 Not this time
 Not this time
 Not this time
