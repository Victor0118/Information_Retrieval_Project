 You send me just colours
 I'm waiting, don't hold back
 
 Trees bow to the wind
 And I'm falling inside you
 
 Slide in
 Feel the future
 Rushing Slowly
 Right now
 
 So close I could touch it
 I'm dreaming
 Don't wake up
 
  Slide in
  Feel the future
  Rushing slowly
  Light now
  
  Nothing makes me
  Feel like
  Show me real love
  Right now
