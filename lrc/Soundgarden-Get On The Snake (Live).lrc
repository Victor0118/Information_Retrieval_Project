      Get on the snake
 With a swarm of motor flies
 Under the Cola colored sky
  Don't worry, everything's clean
  Road worthy, hungry and mean
 Where the metal river bleeds
 Where you never will believe
 Hey baby, what's your disease
 My heart's bleeding
 I'm dying to leave
 Where the water turns to steam
 With a suicide machine
 Hungry and mean...
 Hungry and mean...
