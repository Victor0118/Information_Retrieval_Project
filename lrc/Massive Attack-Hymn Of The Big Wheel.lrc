 (marshall, vowles, del naja, cherry, andy)
 
 
 The big wheel keeps on turning
 On a simple line day by day
 The earth spins on its axis
 One man struggle while another relaxes
 
 There's a hole in my soul like a cavity
 Seems like the world is out to gather just by gravity
 The wheel keeps turning the sky's rearranging
 Look my son the weather is changing
 
 I'd like to feel that you could be free
 Look up at the blue skies beneath a new tree
 Sometime again
 You'll turn green and the sea turns red
 My son I said the power of axis over my head
 The big wheel keeps on turning
 On a simple line day by day
 The earth spins on its axis
 One man struggle while another relaxes
 
 We sang about the sun and danced among the trees
 And we listened to the whisper of the city on the breeze
 Will you cry in the most in a lead-free zone
 Down within the shadows where the factories drone
 On the surface of the wheel they build another town
 And so the green come tumbling down
 Yes close your eyes and hold me tight
 And i'll show you sunset sometime again
 The big wheel keeps on turning
 On a simple line day by day
 The earth spins on its axis
 One man struggle while another relaxes
 
 As a child's silent prayer my hope hides in disguise
 While satellites and cameras watch from the skies
 An acid drop of rain recycled from the sea
 It washed away my shadow burnt a hole in me
 And all the king's men cannot put it back again
 But the ghetto sun will nurture life
 And mend my soul sometime again
 
   The big wheel keeps on turning
   On a simple line day by day
   The earth spins on its axis
   One man struggle while another relaxes
