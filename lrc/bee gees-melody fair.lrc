  Who Is The Girl With The Crying Face
  Looking At Millions Of Signs
  She Knows That Life Is A Running Race
  Her Face Shouldn't Show Any Sign
   Melody Fair Won't You Comb Your Hair
   You Can Be Beautiful Too
   Remember You're Only A Woman Ah Ah
   Remember You're Only A Girl
   Ah.........
 Who Is The Girl At The Window Pane
 Watching The Rain Falling Down
 Melody Life Isn't Like The Rain
 It's Just Like A Merry-Go-Round
