 Check!
 Shut the fuck up! You shut the fuck up!
 Who the fuck are you?
 Who the fuck are you? (I ain't nobody)
 That's the question, the question at hand.
 Oh, man, fuck this. Fuck this! (I ain't nobody)
 
 You know, I lost my place a long time ago
 about fifty fucking rhymes ago
 I'm wrecking again
 I'm seriously considering checking myself in
 Locked inside this key chamber
 There's millions of keys inside
 but only one can stop my anger
 and I'm not fading away, so I'll just have to die
 
Chorus:
 Unlocking the doors in my mind
 How many doors will I find?
 I think I got the key
 I guess I'll just try another if that's the key
 Unlocking the doors in my mind
 How many doors will I find?
 I think I got the key
 I guess I'll just try another if that's the key
