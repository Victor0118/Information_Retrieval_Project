Well, I had me a pigeon
By the name of Fred
But I done shot him
In the head

Had me a railroad
Down on the ridge
But I done blowed up
The bridge

Had me a dog
He was my best friend
But to him
I done put an end

Had me a farm
Sittin' pretty on the hill
But if you look
You'll see it ain't there still

I don't know why I done it
Honest, it ain't like me
But I ain't sad now I done it
'Cause a baby boy has got to be free
