 Stumbled round, you I found
 Adored your glory, you're my story
 Then you let me down, let down
 You know we're the same
 
 Once I frowned, then I found
 The one I love, as if from above
 You smile at me, I smile at you
 We were the same
 
 You are not an enemy
 You are not an enemy
 Gentle as the sky
 Please don't ask me why
 
 You are not an enemy
 You are not an enemy
 Gentle as the sky
 Please don't ask me why
 I cry
