 I had to escape
 The city was sticky and cruel
 Maybe I should have called you first
 But I was dying to get to you
 I was dreaming while I drove
 The long straight road ahead, uh, huh 
 Could taste your sweet kisses
 Your arms open wide
 This fever for you is just burning me up inside 
 
 I drove all night to get to you
 Is that alright
 I drove all night
 Crept in your room
 Woke you from your sleep
 To make love to you
 Is that alright
 I drove all night 
 
 What in this world
 Keeps us from tearing apart
 No matter where I go I hear
 The beating of our one heart
 I think about you
 When the night is cold and dark, uh, huh 
 No one can move me
 The way that you do
 Nothing erases the feeling between me and you 
 
 I drove all night to get to you
 Is that alright
 I drove all night
 Crept in your room
 Woke you from your sleep
 To make love to you
 Is that alright
 I drove all night 
 
 Could taste your sweet kisses
 Your arms open wide
 This fever for you is just burning me up inside 
 
 I drove all night to get to you
 Is that alright
 I drove all night
 Crept in your room
 Is that alright 
 
 I drove all night
 I drove all night to get to you
 Is that alright
 I drove all night
 Crept in your room
 Woke you from your sleep
