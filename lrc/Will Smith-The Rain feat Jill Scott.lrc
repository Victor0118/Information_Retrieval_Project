  
The little rain drops fallin'' down on me 
But I can''t seem to feel it, feel it 
Feel it coming over me 

  
The rain gon'' come through the window, pain will come 
Black, white, rich, poor, it''s the same old drum 
Rainy days like the war, use wisdom as a weapon 
Hold your head up, dry your clothes and keep steppin'' 
Let the children feel the rain, ''cause if they feel the rain 
>From the wetness, they stand to gain 
I came into the game, it felt like the middle of June 
Music was warm, artists, like flowers, they bloom 
Then boom, I shook the room, many felt the thunder 
My time to shine, did it like summer 
I wondered if the sun would shine forever 
Pops said "rain gon'' come", to him I said "never" 
Chedder in the genes, face on screens 
Got a benz wit'' the sheen, but what did it all mean 
I earned money and burned money, credit cards smokin'' 
Platinumn, grammys, famous, but still broke and 
Not having cash put me in check 
Yo, the road to the riches is slippery when wet 
Amongst the fall is where you truly find yourself 
Ever since then, the rain I never felt 
Deal wit'' it 

  

  
At age seventeen, the worst pain, a hurrcaine 
Her first name still conjuers the rain 
Vowed to never let nobody ever get me wet 
Lest we forget, love is a four season concept 
Many say the rain they can''t stand 
Never let the weather determine the man 
God has a plan, from it I never ran 
Follow my heart through the storm, my umbrella in hand 
I''m Noah, life''s my arc 
forty days and forty nights, still can''t take my heart 
Seen the fallen man 
To dope and liquor brands 
The devil''ll dance to make it rain 
Bringing the pain 
Walk through the puddles of struggle on flooded streets 
Soakin'' wet, but mastered the art of peace 
Through grey skies, I grew wise, on bended knees I knelt 
Since then, the rain I never felt 
What''s wit'' it 

  

  
Sometimes I sit in my room, stuff on my mind 
Stress, can''t rest, so I open the blinds 
See kids in the streets, runnin'' around 
It wasn''t touchin'' ''em, but the rain was comin'' down 
I wondered how, with my mouth wide 
Reminisce of the key, said I wanna go outside 
In the rain, to see if the same would happen to me 
''Bout that time, God started rappin'' to me 
He said "pain is the mother of change, the rain must flow 
So the seeds of joy might grow 
Don''t be afraid, find shelter in me 
The road to greatness, through the valley of adversity" 
I felt the light as He proceeded to drop the gem 
These little children, the world we must receive like them 
I just smiled, and thanked Him for the cards He delt 
And since then, the rain I never felt 
What''s wit'' it
