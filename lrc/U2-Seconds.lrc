 Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh
 It takes a second to say goodbye
 Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh, say bye bye...
 Where you going to now...
 
 Lightning flashes across the sky
 East to west, do or die
 Like a thief in the night
 See the world by candlelight.
 
 Fall, rise and...Fall, rise and...
 In an apartment on Time Square
 You can assemble them anywhere
 Held to ransom, hell to pay
 A revolution everyday
 USSR, GDR, London, New York, Peking
 It's the puppets, It's the puppets 
 Who pull the strings
 
 Fall, rise and...Fall, rise and...
 
 Say goodbye, say goodbye
 Say goodbye, say goodbye
 Say goodbye
 
 It takes a second to say goodbye
 Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh
 Push the button and pull the plug
 Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh
 
 Fall, rise and...Fall, rise and...
 
 And they're doing the atomic bomb
 Do they know where the dance comes from
 Yes they're doing the atomic bomb
 They want you to sing along
 Say goodbye, say goodbye
 Say goodbye
 Say goodbye.
