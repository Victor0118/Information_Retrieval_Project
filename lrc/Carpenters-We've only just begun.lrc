 
 
 
 We've only just begun to live
 White lace and promises
 A kiss for luck and we're on our way
 We've only begun
 Before all the rising sun we fly,
 So many roads to choose
 We start our walking and learn to run.
 And yes! We've just begun.
 Sharing horizons that are new to us
 Watching the signs along the way
 Talking it over just the two of us
 Working together day to day
 Together.
 And when the evening comes we smile
 So much of life ahead
 We'll find a place where there's room to grow
 And yes! We've just begun.
 Sharing horizons that are new to us
 Watching the signs along the way
 Talking it over just the two of us
 Working together day to day
 Together.
 Together.
 And when the evening comes we smile
 So much of life ahead
 We'll find a place where there's room to grow
 And yes! We've just begun.
